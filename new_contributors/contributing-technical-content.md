### Welcome to the EngEd Program
First of all we would like to welcome you to the EngEd Program!

The Engineering Education Program (EngEd) at Section was created as a community to provide students a friendly and inviting place to enhance their skills, connect with like-minded students, and help build up their professional portfolios and profiles (upon entering the DEV career space). 

We also offer students the opportunity to write content about related and approved topics about Information Technology Web-related services. (Could be something you are learning currently or a write-up on any EngEd Community Contribution you may have built and contributed).

### Getting started with creating technical content
To get started **we recommend you begin by going over the most recently published student** articles at the link provided to get ideas on [potential topics](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/) and get a better sense of style, quality, and tonality.

#### Suggested courses 
For any new contributors that may need extra assitance on technical writing, please go over these [technical writing courses](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/overview). 

There is a [Technical Writing One introduction](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one) that teaches you how to write clearer technical documentation.

&

There is a [Technical Writing Two introduction](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/two) which helps technical people improve their technical communication skills.

We recommend these courses for any students that may lack experience with technical writing, or students would like to improve their articles before submitting.

For any students that may be having trouble with grammar we suggest this [Just enough grammar](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/just-enough-grammar) course, which provides grammar help.

### Suggesting a topic
Then you are ready to suggests a topic idea to be approved [via this form](https://github.com/section-io/engineering-education/issues/new?assignees=&labels=topic+suggestion&template=enged-content-idea-suggestion.md&title=).

Once the article topic has been approved by our team, you may begin to write your article. Only submit your article as a PR once is it ready to be reviewed and published.

To submit your article you will need to fork over the public repository. You can follow these [step-by-step instructions](https://github.com/section-io/engineering-education/blob/master/new_contributors/UPLOAD_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for help with this step.

After your article is submit it will enter our queue to be reviewed by our Peer Review or Tech Review Committee.

We recently implemented a tiered payout structure that is [outlined here](https://github.com/section-io/engineering-education/blob/master/new_contributors/CONTRIBUTING.md#review-approval--payment-processes).

### Quality expected
*Note: Articles requiring very few edits will be given priority in the review queue, and we reserve the right to refuse any articles that do not adhere to quality standards. PRs with no response from members (comments, edits) after a period of 10 days will be closed (but are able to be reopened if needed).*

Articles are expected to be clearly understood, well-written, pre-checked for English grammatical issues, and technically accurate (with code tested).

We request articles to be cross-checked for readability. All submitted articles should be BOLD & CLEAR, free of any lengthy, complex sentences, and/or common errors.

We will only accept fully polished and ready to be published pull requests (by *fully polished and ready to be published articles* we mean pull request that are submitted in FINAL form draft. Pull requests that require **moderate to major review/revision will either be CLOSED or will not recieve payout upon being published**), only the highest level articles will be eligible to recieve payouts.

Your article can range anywhere from:
- How-To guides  
- Tutorials  
- Software Reviews  
- New Tech Introductions
- Can reference any EngEd contribution implemenation to talk audience through the workflow.

Those listed above are simply a few possible topic ideas to give you an idea.

We hope this helps get you started off on the right foot - and we're always happy to help if you have any questions on the process or the program in general ping us in the Slack EngEd channel.
