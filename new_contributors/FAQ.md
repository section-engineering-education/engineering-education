## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I suggest a topic to write about?
We encourage all new contributors to go over our new contributor folder which has a list of resources to prepare to submit a new topic and article idea. We also suggest to review the most [recently published articles](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/) to avoid topic overlap (and to get a good sense on article style tonality, and quality that we are accepting) submit a topic using [this issue form](https://github.com/section-io/engineering-education/issues/new?assignees=&labels=topic+suggestion&template=enged-content-idea-suggestion.md&title=).

### How do I add my author page
Include a short Author Biography (index.md file) and Headshot image (avatar file). Include these files in the [authors folder](https://github.com/section-engineering-education/engineering-education/tree/master/authors) within the GitHub repo via your forked repo similar to the article files. We want to credit you for your hard work.

### I have a merge conflict - how do I resolve it?
Use this every time before contributing a new article to keep it up to date
git fetch section

git pull --rebase section master

git push origin

This should help prevent any merge conflicts.

For more details on how to submit a PR check out our [contribution guidelines here](https://github.com/section-io/engineering-education/blob/master/new_contributors/UPLOAD_INSTRUCTIONS.md#do-this-once).

### Can I include a video into my articles?
Yes, please refer to our upload instructions for a [step-by-step guide](https://github.com/section-io/engineering-education/blob/master/new_contributors/UPLOAD_INSTRUCTIONS.md#including-videos-in-your-articles) on how to include YT videos into your articles.

### Is there a word limit on articles?
The only requirement is that the article has to be at least 750 words, there is no upper cap limit as we want to ensure we are providing value to the EngEd community and the developer audience at large.

**Articles should be a minimum of 750 words.**

### How does the revision process work?
Article payout will be as follows:
- Articles with (little to no extra revisions needed) payout will be $200.00 USD ($250.00 USD for Tutorials)
- Articles with (2-3 rounds of revisions) payout will be $100.00 USD ($150.00 USD for Tutorials)
- Articles with (3+) and up rounds of revisions) we will consider closing the PR

For the full details on our [review, approval, & payment processes](https://github.com/section-io/engineering-education/blob/master/new_contributors/CONTRIBUTING.md#review-approval--payment-processes) check out the provided link.

### What counts as a round of revision?
Any extra (major) steps that take a reviewer away from the actual revision process (revising, editing, and proofreading) and causes a shift towards content creation.
Any (major) incorrect code snippets (all code should be tested - contributors should take advantage of free tools such as repl.it).
Instances when the content is too difficult to understand.
PRs that may lack sufficient unique* value - (any and all comments made by reviewers to draw out more value from the article are great and encouraged but should be limited)
*by unique we mean content that can NOT simply be found by looking up the official documentation.

Use your EngEd community as a resource - get to know each other and ask for a revision from a fellow contributor before submitting a final draft.

Please do not hesitate to reach out at any time - weâ€™re always happy to help.

### How does one apply to be a Peer Reviewer?
For the Content Stewards (Peer Review Program) we typically look for authors who have contributed a few articles (so that they are familiar with the article submission process) and can guide new contributors along the way.

Most importantly we look for authors who have demonstrated great technical acumen, overall attention to detail (grammar, formatting, etc.), and community engagement.

The position is a compensated position - 50 USD per successful article review.

### Are the positions voluntary or are Peer Reviewers compensated?
We always encourage friendly reviews among the community to help each other out before article submission. Verifired Peer Reviewers are paid $50.00 USD per successful article revision.

### How often are article payouts?
We typically send article payouts once a week (usually of Fridays) but that may vary depending on holidays, sick, or OOO (out-of-office) days.

### Does Section provide revision services?
We will look over the all articles that come in to ensure they are publish worthy - but our peer reviewer team is only looking to improve the content by making suggestions. 
For revisions services we recommend using a few of the [services we have vetted](https://www.fiverr.com/johnbatsoniii/proofread-and-edit-your-writing-for-publication?context_referrer=user_page&ref_ctx_id=9caf75ed-ce79-4880-b2fc-5b09e92e23d6&pckg_id=1&pos=1) - both economical and professional.
