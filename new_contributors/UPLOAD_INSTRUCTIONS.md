## How to upload an article for Sectionâ€™s Engineering Education Program:

**Prerequisites:**
- Github account
- Text editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- Prepared markdown (.md) file. (Note: All articles must be submitted in properly-formatted markdown). See [Github Markdown guide](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

### Fork the repository
In order to upload your prepared .md file to Github, first, click the **Fork** option in the upper right-hand corner (pictured below).

Once you have successfully forked over to your repository:
- You should notice your username in the upper left-hand corner (top red arrow).
- If a Github Action notice pops up, click **Dismiss** (red arrow in the middle).

General rules:
Students should always be branching from their master

Students should always keep their fork up to date with section-io/engineering-education

### Clone the forked repository
Next, you will need to clone the repository to your local computer.

![clone repository](/static/images/clone-repository.png)

Open the newly cloned repository in your text editor. It should look something like this (shown in Visual Studio Code):

Note: When working with multiple articles simultaneously, it's best to create and work on separate branches for each article. (Here is a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPpnCh7InLY&t=577s) on how Github Branches work.)

### Create article folder structure
Within the articles folder (inside the content folder), create a new folder using the intended url for the article. (Reference existing folders' naming conventions.) 

Be sure to:
- **Use all lowercase.**
- **Use dashes in place of spaces.**
- **Do not include any special characters.**
- **Try to keep it under 40 characters.**
- -**Avoid using periods (.) or commas (,)**

Within that article folder, upload your prepared .md file containing article contents using the filename `index.md`. Upload any corresponding image files referenced in your article. When referencing images, be sure to use the following naming convention with your newly created article directory. 

For example:
```
![image title](/new-folder-name/image-name.jpg)
```
If you have a header (hero) image in mind, feel free to include it your PR as well. Please try to keep images as close to 600X400 pixels (images can be resized using [Pixlr Image Editor](https://pixlr.com/e)) and make sure you have the appropriate copyright to use it. Sites like [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) have Creative Commons images which you can use for free.

Any images within the article need to be hosted on our site - place the image in the proper folder) - and have the proper image paths in the article similar to the hero image and have citations (attribution) if required.

Your folder should look similar to this:

### Including videos in your articles
If you would like to include a (step-by-step) video to one of your How To Guide or Tutorial videos feel free to do so as a YouTube iframe. Below is a step by step example on how to include a YT iframe to your .md files.

Upload the [video to YouTube](https://www.wix.com/blog/2019/02/how-to-upload-video-youtube-guide/) (if it isn't already).

![Copy YouTube Embed Code](/static/images/yt-video-embed.png)

Take that copied embed code and paste it into your .md (markdown) file where you would like it to be placed. The code should look something like this:

`<iframe width="956" height="538" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/npnp--SSx_8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>`

*NOTE:* If the width and height are not `width="478" height="269"` be sure to change the sizes to fit our web page format.

Finally, if you're a first time contributor, be sure to include a short Author Biography and Headshot image. Please include the files in the authors folder within the GitHub repo. We want to credit you for your hard work.
