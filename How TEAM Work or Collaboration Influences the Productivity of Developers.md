# How TEAM Work or Collaboration Influences the Productivity of Developers

In our last article, we were able to point out [the Impact of Mathematics on Programming](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/impact-of-mathematics-on-programming/) 

In this article, we are going to be looking at **"How to build a team that Collaborates".**

Building a successful team is more than finding a group of people with the right mix of professional skills.

If you ask enough top executives about their Leadership style, you’re likely to hear a number of them say, **“I hire the best people and get out of their way.”**

It’s a good line that makes sense at a certain level. Hiring the right people is the most important part of building a strong team, and of course, delegating to give people more autonomy is a powerful motivator too.

But managing a team is not that simple. Leaders have to play a far more hands-on role to make sure the group works well together and remains focused on the right priorities. 

In order to build a strong team and increase the Productivity of Developers, you have to consider the following facts.

## The first fact you have to consider is:

 ### 1. You Have to Create a Clear Map.

Leaders owe their teams an answer to the same question that young children often ask their parents before setting out on a long drive:

*“Where are we going and How are we going to get there?”* 

In other words, what is the goal and how are we going to measure progress along the way? 

The trouble often starts when leaders start listing five or seven or 11 priorities. 

As Jim Collins, the author of the best-selling management book **“Good to Great”** and **“Built to Last,”** is fond of saying: **“If you have more than three priorities, you don’t have any.”**

Determining these priorities and how they’re going to be measured is arguably the most important job of a team leader because most of the work that everybody does will flow from those goals.

Those priorities have to be lined up as carefully as the trajectory of a rocket launch because the slightest miscalculation can take a team off-course over time.

## The second fact you have to consider is:

### 2. You Need to Have a Shared Scoreboard.

Another benefit of having a simple plan is that it creates a shared goal that will offset the tendency of people to identify themselves as part of smaller groups.

Think of a football team, for example:

There are many **“tribes”** within a team – offense and defense, linemen and receivers, running backs and defensive backs. But because the goal of the team is clear, and there’s an external scoreboard to track the progress of the team, there is a greater sense of **“us”** on the team than the **“us and them”** dynamic that can often divide colleagues into companies.

*I am sure this is very clear.*

## The last fact you have to consider is:

### 3.  You Have to Create Your Team's Culture.

All families have values, even if they aren’t discussed explicitly. There are certain behaviors that are encouraged and discouraged — like rules of the road — for how everyone is going to (try to) get along and spend their time. 

Teams aren’t really that different.

Pull together a group of people to work on any project, and they will develop a culture of their own, and it will be as unique as the people in the group. 

Considering all these facts or factors would be great for the productivity of Developers.

Looking at how I started as a self-learned Developer, most of the obstacles I met really drained me and I felt like giving up most of the time.

But I discovered that with the help of my team, anytime I am down, they're always there for me not just with their words of encouragement but, they encourage a means of solving most difficult problems with me.

You can agree with me that a problem shared is a  problem solved.

Working with the rest of the team has been amazing because I was able to learn different approaches, different methods, algorithms, hacks, and tricks.

You get to realize that there are better ways of doing things than you actually know.

One thing about working in a team, especially for Juniors is that you don't pay for the new knowledge you get while working on projects, it's free and time-saving.

An increase in Delivery time is one skill I strongly believe I wouldn't have been able to achieve on my own. Everyone is working with a timeframe so I don't have to relent, I have to get the job done before the deadline.

This article is serving as an introduction to this new series, so make sure you're following up.

Soon, I will be publishing a standard article on TEAM Work as a major role of Productivity.
