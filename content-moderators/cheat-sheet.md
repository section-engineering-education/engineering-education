### Cheat Sheet: Template Responses
Below are some copy and paste responses we have useful from time to time: Feel free to modify and/or edit for your situation and document here.

### Closing Topic/Article Suggestions (or PRs)

#### Closing Due to Grammar/Readability

"There are some significant readability challenges in your description that raise concerns over how much review/editing would be required from our peer review team. We don't provide editing services and recommend that students leverage online editing services (there are both free and paid services that you can explore), or try engaging with the community or other peers in your network to have them review prior to submitting a revised proposal. Thank you."

#### Closing Due to Topic Area

"Thank you for the topic suggestion @**{author username}**, however this is a bit outside of our preferred topic areas. We're more interested in original, practitioner-focused content that takes a deeper dive into programming-centric concepts. Please feel free to suggest an alternate topic to explore." üöÄ

#### Closing Due to Not Being Unique Enough
Thank you for your response and we thank you for submitting your topic.
After some careful consideration it struck us that this topic may be a bit over saturated throughout other blog sites and official documentations as previously mentioned on your topic form by our content moderator.

We typically refrain from publishing content that is covered widely on the net or other blogs. As we're more interested in original, practitioner-focused content that takes a deeper dive into programming-centric concepts.

We believe this is the best way for students to build a great portfolio (for potential employers) is by building what does not exist and what can provide the most value.

You are more than welcome to pursue another more in depth topic - or continue working on this one by flushing it out a bit more (i.e. making it more in depth - "such as covering the video and audio APIs like this article and/or providing more detail about how the APIs work or some suggestions to readers as to how they could extend the web app shown (i.e. what extra functionality they could implement).")

We will be closing the PR simply to make room in the queue - but we can gladly reopen it anytime once the article is publish ready

#### Closing Due to Multiple Queued Articles

To help avoid a backlog queue (and longer review times) we are currently only accepting ONE article TOPIC/PR approved at a time üëç. We can re-open this topic - once the 1st one has been merged/published.

#### Closing an article due to it NOT being publish ready
It seems this PR is still quite a bit aways from being completed. It also seems this PR is rather light on substance. We will be closing this and please re-submit when it is ready to be published as a new PR (and you can add the duplicate label) and ping the reviewer.

Closing a PR does NOT mean the article can not be published (or fixed) it simply means that the edits, revisions, and fixes will happen outside of the queue. üëç
Be sure to consult previously published materials to get a better understanding of the level of quality the community expects.

Please feel free to go through our provided resources as well - those are there to help all our students improve their overall technical writing. To be able to take those skills to any position or program.

### Asking Questions in Topic Suggestions

#### Prompt for Details of Originality

"Could you please expand upon how your content will differ from what is already available through the **{website/technology name}** website and documentation? We lean towards content that offers an original viewpoint/approach around programming-centric topics."

"Upon giving your article an overview it seems that there is much we could add for the reader(s). We're really looking for unique/original content, and based on the content provided, it seems that information that you intend to cover is already readily available through the documentation or via many other blog sites. An alternate path might be to create a unique project using a **{topic name}**?"

Hi, @**{author username}**. Thanks for submitting a topic suggestion. From looking at your article idea, it seems that there is much we could add for to benefit readers but we're really looking for unique/original content, and based on the content provided, it seems that information that you intend to cover is already readily available through the documentation and other blog sites.
