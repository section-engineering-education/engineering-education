### Content Moderators Documentation
Currently, we have **four** documents that provide information about our Content Moderator role and final review process.

Please suggest any improvements or additions through a GitHub [PR](https://github.com/section-engineering-education/engineering-education/compare) or alternatively, discuss them in the [#content-moderator](https://sectionio-community.slack.com/archives/C024LB2F09K) Slack channel.

- **How to preview using Hugo**: This tutorial instructs new Content Moderators on how to download Hugo and then configure it to render/preview the [Section Engineering Education](https://github.com/section-engineering-education/engineering-education) repo locally using our static site generator, Hugo.

- **Approving Topics**: A guide on the topic approval process and the types of articles we look for/accept for the Engineering Education blog.

- **Cheat Sheet**: A list of template responses that Content Moderators can use/adapt when responding to topic suggestions.

- **Final Front Matter Review**: The front matter should already be added by our peer review team - but we ALWAYS want to check the DATE/TIME. This is to ensure your published article comes after the most recently published article - use the Mountain Time Zone. Read the document to discover other things to check.

- **EngEd Peer Review Guide Standards**: a more detailed guide on how to review articles (focusing on preliminary and technical review) which includes the most common mistakes contributors make - **located in the peer_reviewer folder**.
