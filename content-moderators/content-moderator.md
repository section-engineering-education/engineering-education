### Content Moderator - Content Peer Review Committee (Final Reviewer)
We are always working on ways to make the EngEd community more inclusive while growing and enriching the content contributed by our members.

We are seeking to improve our Peer Review Committee (Content Stewards program) to further streamline the overall process by empowering our community members to elevate the Engineering Education program (and community) as a whole.

Section’s EngEd Program Managers will select Content Moderators from within the EngEd Content Peer Review Committee based on consistency and value to the program and community, including:

- Community engagement (contributions, interactions, etc.)
- Attention to program details, repo status, and peer channel
- Full understanding of the community guidelines and process

Content Moderators will be largely responsible for Final Reviews (articles labeled for final review) of the articles.

They will:
- check that all front matter and entire article is accurate and ready to be published
- they will have access to preview articles via Hugo - full details laid out in Final

### Review docs

- help create community docs to guide and instruct new contributors and peer reviewers.
