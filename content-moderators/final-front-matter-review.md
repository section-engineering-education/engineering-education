### The Front Matter Final Review Process: 

>NOTE: The front matter should already be added by our peer review team - but sometimes they may forget (and most of the time we need to fix some minor things) we ALWAYS want to check the DATE/TIME - the EngEd site (entire Section site) is running on MST - so please be aware of this time difference and use a world clock to see the appropriate time. 

This is to ensure your published article comes after the most recently published article.

DOES NOT HAVE TO BE IN BULLET FORMAT - that was for organization in this file.

- Line 11: Leave as is - needs to be true to publish
- Line 12: First part should always be /engineering-education/ followed by the name of the .md file (should be name of article) - This will be the URL on the site. Best to extend acornyms for better search results.
