### Content Moderators Documentation
Currently, we have _ documents that provide information about our Content Moderator role and final review process. 

Please suggest any improvements or additions through a Github PR or alternatively, discuss them in the #content-moderator Slack channel.

- Final front matter review: The front matter should already be added by our peer review team - but we ALWAYS want to check the DATE/TIME. This is to ensure your published article comes after the most recently published article.

- How to preview using Hugo: This tutorial gives the Content Moderator how to download Hugo then use it to render/preview the [Section Engineering Education](https://github.com/section-engineering-education/engineering-education) repo locally using Hugo stactic site generator.

- EngEd Peer Review Guide Standards: a more detailed guide on how to review articles (focusing on preliminary and technical review) which includes the most common mistakes contributors make.
