### Post-publish review check list
#### Final review after we publish an article (merge a PR)
This list will help us prepare the list of articles to payout every week - and will help us make sure we are not missing any article.

Included is a [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10RlhQIyoBcZwkIWEetGPsrpJ1QgdrKmQm_fIZrdinlI/edit#gid=0) that will serve as our weekly list. On that sheet we've added notes (as comments) to each block on the top examples towards the top. 

The idea is that each CM will be responsible for any article(s) they publish.

Once an article is published - add the name of the article (with hyperlink to published article) and add the name of the Peer reviewer as well to the list.

Then add whether the article is an **informative article or a tutorial based articles** - notes to the difference between the two can be found in our [FAQ](https://github.com/section-engineering-education/engineering-education/blob/master/new_contributors/FAQ.md).

At this time we can also do some final checks on the published article:
- we can look at the author image - see if it is too large (could be cropped)
- we can look at the topic - if the article has the correct topic, or if it could use one.
- we can look over the title make sure it is correct - if it needs any capitalized letters.
- anything else we can think of

>**What is the difference between a tutorial and an article?**
>A tutorial is a walk-through implementation on a topic. For example: How to set up Ubuntu on Linux. Steps laid out, with screenshots, and accompanying snippets. An article is a piece describing, explaining, or exploring a topic (with out any steps on HOW TO implement). For example - The Difference between Java and C++.
