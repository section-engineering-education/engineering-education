### Topic Approval Guidelines/Criteria
#### Approval Guidance
When looking to approve topics for the EngEd library, we are really looking for original content. What do we mean by original content? 

We are referring to a topic that is NOT already readily available through the official documentation or through other blogs. If it’s a popular topic, there should be a unique twist that makes it different from similar comparison, how to, intro or tutorial articles.

Currently, we are approving ONE topic/PR per student at a time - this was to help the overflowing of PRs in the queue. [Helps prevent multiple articles from the same author with multiple edits - as only polished - ready to publish articles should be coming in].

This means we need to check if the student has more than one TOPIC or PR submitted (we can do this by clicking on the name of the student via GitHub - in the issues section) and it pulls up every topic they’ve submitted.

If they have more than one - check that the older one has not already been published (or has a PR attached to it - if it should - attach the topic to the PR.)

We are looking for unique, practitioner-focused content that takes a deeper dive into programming-centric concepts. 

We are looking to approve topic suggestions that are grammatically correct and have good readability to ensure that the student is putting their article through a thorough editing review prior to submitting for final approval. (We can refer them to some of the great free tools that we curated in the EngEd resources to help - see Cheat Sheet below for a templated response)

Any topic that already seems to have many grammatical errors and/or very little substance to go off on - we can close those. Then leave a comment explaining why we closed it - see Cheat Sheet below for a templated response.

We should NOT expect that every TOPIC we approve will be published. 

Anything in the Hardware department is a hard NO - we are more software centric - and any technologies that are Section adjacent are always a good topic. 

We are looking for content that solves pain points for developers in the real world today - something that has not been hash over and over again - but something that developers are looking for (and forward) to dive into.
