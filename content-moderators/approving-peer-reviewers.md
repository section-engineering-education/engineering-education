### Peer Reviewer Approval Guidelines/Criteria
#### Approval Guidance
When looking to add new peer reviewers to the team, we are looking for veterans contributors of the EngEd progam. 

A lot of our students may speak English as a second language - which is perfectly fine - but our audience (the readers of our articles) are in USA - and the articles need to be polished enough to publish.

That is why we try to only train veteran authors - who are familiar with the level of quality we are looking for to help others get their work (portfolios) published.

### Approval Process
If a student show interest in becoming a peer reviewer. We should 1st see how many articles/tutorials the contributors has published with us. 3-4 is minimum number of articles needed, to able to determine that the student is familiar with our EngEd process and how to contribute/submit an article. 

We advise any potential Peer Reviewers to go through our entire resources page to see what resources are available and what they can share with students who may need them during a review.

### Tryout
We recently created the "tryout label" to let the team know that these students have NOT done a test review yet BUT have expressed interest in performing a test review to join the PR team. 
This new "tryout" extra step should help identify quality reviewers. By checking the quality of latest incoming article before allowing the student to do a test is should help us better evaluate potential peer reviewers.

Current labels:
- *Tryout label: Student is interested in doing a test review.*
- *Test review label: student is in the process of doing a test review to see if they are an ideal addition to the PR team.*

The final decisions will be voted on by the CM team.

### Test Review
If we determine that the contributor is an ideal candidate to perform a test review we share our peer reviewer folder documents to help them start the onboarding process. 

>NOTE: In some case we can either look back at past published articles to gauge quality - or ask the student to perform a test review w/o a tryout phase.

To perform a test review we ask the potential peer reviewer to go through the list of pull requests (PRs) and find one (**the older the better since we typically review 1st come 1st serve**) they would like to review.

We then add the "test reviewer" label to the PR via GitHub to help us keep track. 

After the test review - we can go over the PR with a Final Review and see where the student could improve their reviews. 

### Test Review Pull Request Merged 
The Content Moderators who are doing final reviews that week - will be responsible for reviewing, analyzing, and approving/denying the potential reviewer.

If the test review was NOT passed - the student can try again (at the discretion of the CM) if the review was on the fence. (3 reviews Max - if the student needs more test reviews than that - they can try out again at a later date when we need more peer reviewers.)

The final decisions will be voted on by the Content Moderator team. 

Criteria to approve a potential peer reviewer:
- Attention to detail (grammar, formatting, etc.)
- Pull requests are formatted correctly
- Checking for quality content (closes sub par content)
- Provides much value to the CM team
- Improves quality of incoming content and great mentor to authors
- Understands front matter

Once we have detrimined that the student is comfortable with the material provided and is ready to do real reviews - we can ping Hector or Molly to get the student set up with the proper GitHub permissions and invited into the proper Slack channel(s).

### Templated responses
#### Example 1
Thank you for reaching out and showing interest in becoming a peer reviewer.
 
Before we can begin this process - we would first have to gauge the level of writing of each student and more importantly - the quality of reviews a student can provide his peers.
 
How many articles have you published with us ?
 
The best way to get this started would be to submit another article (ping me on it - to keep track of it) - with little to no revisions needed - as this would be a perfect indication to the team that you would be an ideal fit to become a peer reviewer.

#### Example 2
Thank you for reaching out and showing interest in the Peer Review program.

We know you are quite familiar with our process - as you have published a few articles with us.
The best way to get a better understanding of the review process is to go through our documents. I've shared a few docs to help you get started off on the right foot.

We have also placed most of these and more updated resources in our peer reviewer folder to walk us through the process.
After you feel comfortable with the material provided - we can proceed by doing a simple test run review.

Please go through the list of pull requests (PRs) and find one (the older the better since we typically review 1st come 1st serve) you would like to review - and we can go through it in steps to answer any questions that may pop up.
When you find one that you want to review - send it to me and I can make a comment on it to keep track on my end as well.

#### Example 3
Good morning  - that is correct - we have been trying to fill a few open positions on the Peer Reviewer team.
When was your last article published? 

Im asking because that would help us gauge the level of quality in your article - plus it would help us see your level of familiarity with the program to help other students along with the process.

#### Example 4
Thank you for expressing an interest in the peer reviewer program.
We are currently looking to fill a few positions - we can send over some material to help you better understand the review process as a whole.

The best way to start is to submit an article that requires little to no revision to be published.
This is a great indication to the team that you're a great candidate for to join the peer review team.
