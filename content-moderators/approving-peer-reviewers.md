### Peer Reviewer Approval Guidelines/Criteria
#### Approval Guidance
When looking to add new peer reviewers to the team, we are looking for veterans contributors of the EngEd progam. 

A lot of our students may speak English as a second language - which is perfectly fine - but our audience (the readers of our articles) are in USA - and the articles need to be polished enough to publish.

That is why we try to only train veteran authors - who are familiar with the level of quality we are looking for to help others get their work (portfolios) published.

We can advise any potential Peer Reviewers to go through our resources page to see what resources can be shared with students who may need them. 

We should see how many articles/tutorials the contributors has published with us. 3-4 is minimum number of articles to able to determine that the student is familiar with our EngEd process and how to contribute/submit an article. 

If we determine that the contributor is an ideal candidate to become a Peer Reviewer we can share our peer reviewer folder documents to help them start the onboarding process.

We can either look back at past published articles to gauge quality - or ask the student to perform a test review. 

With a test review we ask the potential peer reviewer to go through the list of pull requests (PRs) and find one (the older the better since we typically review 1st come 1st serve) they would like to review.

We can add the "test reviewer" label to the PR via GitHub to help us keep track. 

After the test review - we can go over the PR with a Final Review and see where the student could improve their reviews. 

Once we have detrimined that the student is comfortable with the material provided and is ready to do real reviews - we can ping Hector or Molly to get the student set up with the proper GitHub permissions and invited into the proper Slack channel(s).

### Templated responses
#### Example 1
Thank you for reaching out and showing interest in becoming a peer reviewer.
 
Before we can begin this process - we would first have to gauge the level of writing of each student and more importantly - the quality of reviews a student can provide his peers.
 
How many articles have you published with us ?
 
The best way to get this started would be to submit another article (ping me on it - to keep track of it) - with little to no revisions needed - as this would be a perfect indication to the team that you would be an ideal fit to become a peer reviewer.

#### Example 2
Thank you for reaching out and showing interest in the Peer Review program.

We know you are quite familiar with our process - as you have published a few articles with us.
The best way to get a better understanding of the review process is to go through our documents. I've shared a few docs to help you get started off on the right foot.

We have also placed most of these and more updated resources in our peer reviewer folder to walk us through the process.
After you feel comfortable with the material provided - we can proceed by doing a simple test run review.

Please go through the list of pull requests (PRs) and find one (the older the better since we typically review 1st come 1st serve) you would like to review - and we can go through it in steps to answer any questions that may pop up.
When you find one that you want to review - send it to me and I can make a comment on it to keep track on my end as well.

#### Example 3
Good morning  - that is correct - we have been trying to fill a few open positions on the Peer Reviewer team.
When was your last article published? 

Im asking because that would help us gauge the level of quality in your article - plus it would help us see your level of familiarity with the program to help other students along with the process.

#### Example 4
Thank you for expressing an interest in the peer reviewer program.
We are currently looking to fill a few positions - we can send over some material to help you better understand the review process as a whole.

The best way to start is to submit an article that requires little to no revision to be published.
This is a great indication to the team that you're a great candidate for to join the peer review team.
