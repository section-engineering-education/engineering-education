### Peer Reviewers Documentation

Currently, we have three documents that provide information about the peer review process. 

Please suggest any improvements or additions through a Github PR or alternatively, discuss them in the #peer-reviewers Slack channel.

- New Peer Reviewer Checklist: provides a list of steps peer reviewers can use to review articles with screenshots on how to assign yourself an article and labels you can use). There's also a [Notion template version](https://www.notion.so/5580246e780e4c8e91478281015b8237?v=ecc4ab28084149f18629887fa1544137) which you can check out as well.

- The EngEd Review Process: gives a high level overview of the entire article submission and review process and includes details of the new tiered payout system and how that impacts reviews

- EngEd Peer Review Guide Standards: a more detailed guide on how to review articles (focusing on preliminary and technical review) which includes the most common mistakes contributors make.
