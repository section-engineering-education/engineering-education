### EngEd Peer Review Guide Standards
contributed by Louise Findlay

### Review Guide Standards:
For all reviewers:
- Only self-assign 1-2 PRs at a time. Only after getting one completed and published should you self-assign more. This allows other Peer Reviewers the ability to take on the next ones.

- For any new Peer Reviewers that have just joined the team:

### New Peer Reviewers
- The first couple of articles they review will be double checked by either another member of the Peer Reviewer Committee or Tech Review Committee. (For a double check)
- Once those initial reviews are passed - then they can begin reviewing incoming PRs to be merged.
- We are building a very diverse community and we should allow our content to showcase that diversity as long as ALL content is accurate, original, and legible.
- We MUST limit PR comments - in order to use our time wisely we need to be able to work on PRs in a timely manner.

### Review - Section Managers
- Plagiarism Check (will be done through [Quetext](https://www.quetext.com/search) by managers) if you do not see a comment via GitHub ping a manager.
- Check proper folder/file structure
- Add an article description (doesn't exceed 150 characters)
- Add hero image from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) (if needed - make sure its 600 X 400 pixels)
- Add ready to review GitHub label

### Preliminary Revision
- Add preliminary revision in progress label
- Add assigned for review label
- Add yourself as an assignee & reviewer (help to the team keep track)
- If new contributor (they will be labeled new contributor): *Add good first issue label*
	- If it’s a 1st-time contributor - let’s take a moment to welcome them to the community (as they may have gone straight to the GitHub repo and not Slack)
	- If it’s a 1st-time contributor - let's set the expectation that the 1st article is going to serve as a guide to improve (if needed) any future PRs - link to any resources.
- Request author bio and headshot (if not already included)
	- Add author page in proper folder
	- Check Markdown formatting (code blocks, syntax highlighting, headings - h3 onwards)
- Check links work and lead to the intended website
- Check image paths (do images show up?)
- Image Sources (are there external images that need to be attributed?)
- Spelling and Grammar Review (Grammarly is a good checker) - US English
	- When reviewing for grammar, (we should point out any "grammatical mistakes and redundancies") with a general statement made a GitHub comment, if we notice many grammar mistakes, we can state in our comments something to the affect of “nice article but we noticed a few/or many grammatical errors please revisit and correct any grammatical issues". It is the authors responsibility to find and correct the issues (of course we can highlight a few - to guide them at what we are looking at)
- When reviewing for *Style/Tone* we should encourage author creativity as long as the content presented is **accurate and legible**.
- The article should make sense from start to finish, for example, if a “plot thread” is started but never elaborated on we should consider omitting those sentences or section.
- Each article should add unique value. By which we mean that the article should be in-depth enough to provide additional value to readers (we want to ensure the article is not simply repeating official documentation definitions to the audience, but adding unique value).
- If edits are minor - select approve
- If edits are major - select request changes
- If multiple revisions are required: and the reviewer has not requested another review from you, click the Request review button to do it yourself. This will let you add another review.
- Add your review using GitHub's built-in Review system
- Add comments at the specific line. Contributors can reply to these comments.
- Write a comment before you publish your review - be positive but mention overall areas to be changed.

### Tech Review
- Remove preliminary revision label
- Add tech review label
- If tech review is out of scope:
- Remove assigned for review label
- Remove yourself from assignees
- Ping a manager or chat in Slack channel for it to be reassigned
- If you are just tech reviewing: remember you can still pick up on preliminary revision issues such as grammar. Multiple eyes are better than just one
- Check for technical inaccuracies in wording
- Follow the instructions/code blocks are check everything works
- Use the appropriate OS if specified
- Make sure syntax is correct
- Suggest best practices to improve code
- Check the software/technology mentioned isn't outdated, depreciated or using a version that is.
- Check article is easy to follow for targeted proficiency level. Beginners shouldn't be confused if the article is aimed at them,
- See if the article could benefit from more screenshots to illustrate concepts or instructions.
- Submit review as in Preliminary Revision - requested reviews if needed
- Finally, ping and Ready for Final review - for manager to get the article merged.

### Common Mistakes to Look Out For
- Comma Splices
- Run-on sentences
- Correct version of word (Let’s vs lets)
- Incorrect use of Pronouns
- Incorrect capitalization.
- Mixing up possessive and plural forms.
