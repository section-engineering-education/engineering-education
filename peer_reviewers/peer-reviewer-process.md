### The EngEd Review Process:
#### Idea Approval:
- Student can enroll to the EngEd program via our [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTbj3kqvEJEb5RLjqJurfbHa8ckzQx0CjRzaizblue9ZOK5A/viewform?usp=sf_link)
- We suggest all students start by reading the recently [published articles](/) to get a better sense of style and tonality the student
- The student can then submit a topic idea using this [Idea Content Form](https://github.com/section-io/engineering-education/issues/new?assignees=&labels=topic+suggestion&template=enged-content-idea-suggestion.md&title=) to be approved.
- Idea Content Form submission triggers posted notification in our community Slack channel for others to see.
- The Section team reviews topic and gives yay/nay, or will ask further qualifying questions.
- After the topic has been approved, the student can then go off and write the article [students may have other questions in between - e.g. -- [How do I submit a PR - branches - hero image](/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

#### In Initial Review:
- Students need to submit all PRs in GitHub with proper folder structure [following provided documentation](/blob/master/UPLOAD_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for the Section team to reviews the article:
- Submitted articles need to come with proper formatting (description of article - hero image 600x400 pixels - correct links - proper image path(s) - and image sources], grammar, plagiarism check (will be checked via Quetext by the managers - if you do not see a comment on PR please ping a manager)
- Rounds of Revisions - with the implementation of the new tier payout structure we need to ensure that our feedback is sufficient enough to guide students on their edits, with clear suggestions on any required edits.
- If reading an article and we notice a section that could benefit (add sufficient value to the audience) from added content, make it clear in a comment on how the contributor may add said content.

#### In Tech Review:
- Tech review any articles you have self-assigned and/or any PR revisions requested in open PR (if needed) if major tech revisions have been made by contributor please re-review new commits.

### Tiered Payout Structure
- All payouts will be as follows:
3/3/21
To continue increasing that level of quality and value for the community - we’d like to notify everyone of an update in the payout structure. 

Over the next few months, we will publish the first 60 approved articles within the month (i.e. 60 articles per month).

Our new payout structure will be:

- $150 for tutorials
- $100 for non-tutorial content
- $50/article for peer reviews

We need to be keen on closing articles that are not "publish ready" i.e. an article that is not ready to be published as is (or as close as possible) - the incoming articles should only require a review from our team not a revision.

#### When should we close PRs during review?
- Any extra (major) steps that take a reviewer away from the actual revision process (revising, editing, and proofreading) and causes a shift towards content creation.
- Any (major) incorrect code snippets (all code should be tested - contributors should take advantage of free tools such as repl.it).
- Instances when the content is too difficult to understand.
- PRs that may lack sufficient *unique* value - (any and all comments made by reviewers to draw out more value from the article are great and encouraged but should be limited as we DO NOT want to re-write the articles - we want to help the contributor draw his/her point out.)

*by unique we mean content that can NOT simply be found by looking up the official documentation.*

**Note: To test this new tier system - we will start by calling a “round of revision” - any major back-and-forth between reviewer and contributor.**
