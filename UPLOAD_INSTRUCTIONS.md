## How to upload an article for Sectionâ€™s Engineering Education Program:

**Prerequisites:**
- Github account
- Text editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- Prepared markdown (.md) file. (Note: All articles must be submitted in properly-formatted markdown.) 

### Fork the repository
In order to upload your prepared .md file to Github, first, click the **Fork** option in the upper right-hand corner (pictured below).

Once you have successfully forked over to your repository:
- You should notice your username in the upper left-hand corner (top red arrow).
- If a Github Action notice pops up, click **Dismiss** (red arrow in the middle).

### Clone the forked repository
Next, you will need to clone the repository to your local computer.

Open the newly cloned repository in your text editor. It should look something like this (shown in Visual Studio Code):

Note: When working with multiple articles simultaneously, it's best to create and work on separate branches for each article. (Here is a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPpnCh7InLY&t=577s) on how Github Branches work.)

### Create article folder structure
Within the articles folder, create a new folder using the intended url for the article. (Reference existing folders' naming conventions.) Be sure to:
- Use all lowercase.
- Use dashes in place of spaces.
- Do not include any special characters.
- Try to keep it under 40 characters.

Within that article folder, upload your prepared .md file containing article contents using the filename `index.md`. Upload any corresponding image files referenced in your article. When referencing images, be sure to use the following naming convention with your newly created article directory. For example: 
```
![image title](/engineering-education/new-folder-name/image-name.jpg)
```
If you have a Header image in mind - (for the hero image) -feel free to include it your PR as well - please try to keep images as close to 600X400 pixels (images can be resized in paint) - also please make sure the image is from a site like www.unsplash.com

Any images within the article need to be host on our site - place the image in the proper folder - and have the proper image paths in the article similar to the hero image. 
With proper citation if required.

Your folder should look similar to this:

![folder contents](/images/folder-contents.png)

Once your files are properly uploaded and organized, add, commit, and push your changes to your forked remote Github repository either using the command line or Github tooling within your text editor.

### Create pull request
Open Github. You should see a message indicating your pushed changes with a button to 'Compare & pull request'.
