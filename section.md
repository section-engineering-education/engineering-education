# How to get started with Competitive Programming: A Complete Roadmap
   Whether you're a high schooler, a University student, or a Developer in mid-30's, this is the perfect time to start with Competitive Programming. Yeah, you heard it right! Competitive Programming does not have age-bar or portfolio limitations. It only requires a passionate spirit with some love for codes. 

All the big companies' hiring programs generally have technical interviews. These interviews usually consist of coding rounds. Data Structures & Algorithms come handy in solving these rounds. Since these are the core parts of Competitive Programming, it becomes a very good option to ace the interviews. This is a blog post meant to many people who have ever tried to start competitive programming but didn't find where to go ahead and left in midway. And also to those who wonder where to start from, to enter this wonderful kingdom.

Without wasting any time, let's dig in deep & start discussing one by one about every major aspect of Competitive Programming by answering all the **Why(s), What(s) & How(s)!**

## What is Competitive Programming?
   As Wiki says,
   >Competitive programming is a mind sport usually held over the Internet or a local network, involving participants trying to program according to provided specifications.
   
   **Long story, short:** It is a type of contest where a number of programmers take part to solve some programming questions in a limited amount of time. You can write your solution in any programming language you’re comfortable with. Your solutions will be judged by online judges. It should pass all the test cases (given and hidden) to get accepted under certain time and space limits. 
   
   A lot of big tech companies like Facebook and Google hire through Competitive programming contests too. Various online competitions have some amazing prizes for the winners as well.

## Why should I do Competitive Programming in the first place? What are the benefits?
   - ### Crack the Coding Interviews: 
      Normally in coding interviews, easy and medium level questions of competitive coding are asked with some fewer tweaks. Performing well in online platforms provides confidence in coding interviews and get internships & job offers from reputed companies.

   - ### Problem Solving Skills: 
      One of the real benefits of competitive coding comes when we start solving problems on our own. In most of the contest, you will be given some real-word problems and you need to solve them in the best possible way in limited time. This increases our analytical and thinking abilities. Our logic building improves and thus helping a lot in developing real-life products. 

   - ### Build better Software Practices: 
      It helps us to build up several logics, write up a clean code, better understand the functions and modules, analyze and interpret several alternatives & features, and finally bring meaningful insights to the software products.

   - ### Land in your Dream Company: 
      Various companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc conduct online coding competitions and they directly hire candidates based on their performance in the competition.

   - ### Working as a Team: 
      Most of the coding competitions happen in groups of 2-4 people. Different individuals can be good at different stuff. Coming up with different energies gives a good platform to nurture an interdisciplinary skills environment. Having proper coordination and management is the key to ace these coding contests.


## Okay, this looks really cool but how to get started? Is there a roadmap or something?
   - ### Pick a suitable programming language: 
      You can do competitive programming in any programming language but it is highly recommended that you choose one of C/C++, Java, or even Python. Learn about all the syntaxes, in-built functions, templates, snippets, and library functions such as STL in C++, Big Integers in Java, etc. Working more on the fundamentals will give a long term benefit to an individual.
   - ### Choose a powerful code editor: 
      You will be solving up many problems. To increase the speed and efficiency, it is recommended to write your codes in a code editor. VS Code, Sublime Text 3, PyCharm & Vim are some of the popular editors where you use their cool features and practice the battle. Use STL, snippets, and templates whenever you can. It not only saves your code length but also decreases the time to write your code. Hence you can focus more on actually solving the main logic of the problems instead of worrying about other stuff.  
   - ### Choose a few platforms to practice & start participating in contests: 
      There are so many platforms in the bucket list. Let's count - [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/),  [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/), [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/dynamic-programming/introduction-to-dynamic-programming-1/tutorial/), [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)... A beginner should always start with [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)! It has a good set of problems placed in a well-defined manner according to the tags & difficulty levels and undoubtedly has the best user interface & IDE. For references about the Data Structures & Algorithms, one should always consider [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and the original documentations like [CPPreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/). After solving sufficient problems, jump into the actual game arena, i.e., Codeforces & Codechef. Practice as many problems as you can, whenever you get stuck over some problems, do check out contest's editorials as well as the discussion sections.
   - ### Learn the basic Data Structures and Algorithm concepts: 
      Nearly every coding problem will require the usage of a specific data structure or algorithm for an optimal solution. Knowing basic data structures and algorithmic techniques before you start is a must. Data Structures and Algorithms are something that helps you in making the program more efficient. Having a good amount of knowledge in DSA will help you in selecting the optimal Data Structure for any problem and implementing it with the most optimum logic. Geeksforgeeks is your one-stop destination for all the Data Structures and Algorithm concepts. It has a wide variety of articles on various data structures & trivial and non-trivial algorithms.
   - ### Solving Different Problems: 
      Repeatedly solving similar problems again & again is not going to benefit you anyhow. It will keep you in the wrong bubble. Instead, start solving sufficient problems until you master that concept diligently and then jumps to another one. Also, try to solve the problem initially with pen & paper. This will give you the right foundation and proper roadmap to deliver large, scale, optimized, and bug-free codes.   

##    So I just jumped into one of the platforms but stuck in the problem. How to approach them?
   - ### Problem Statement: 
      Always give time to read the problem statement, carefully. Don't be in a hurry, when you are reading the problem because this may result in the wrong interpretation of the problem and as a result of this, you will write the wrong code. Remember, 40% of the problem is already solved by merely understanding the statement carefully.
   - ### Important points: 
      Break the whole problem into smaller sub-problems, these are easier to handle. So, while reading the problem, make a note of important points that you are going to solve.
   - ### Constraints: 
      Before writing the code, you should look for the input/output constraints given in the question. This will help you in deciding the time complexity of your code and you need not change the code again and again because if the code is not according to the constraints, then you will get the TLE error.
   - ### Input/Output format: 
      Always take input in the given format and never use your own format. If you are not following it, then you will get the wrong answer instead of having the right code.
   - ### Write the code and test: 
      After deciding the time complexity, write the code and first test your code for the sample input, and if it passes then submit your code and test for other test cases. Also, try to dry run the code for boundary/edge cases, this will help in testing our code for hidden test cases.

## More details on Online Competitions: 
   - Always participate in Online Coding Contests that happens regularly on various websites. This is the best tool to measure your actual position, where you currently stand, and in which areas you need to practice more. By rectifying our mistakes & failures and working over the same, we eventually help ourselves to make that long leap to success. Also, the cherry on the cake, there are also captivating rewards in these contests for the winners.
