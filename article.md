# FLUTTER VS KOTLIN

Earlier people used to prefer React Native in order to code cross-platform development but today, Kotlin has managed to enter into the world of cross-platform development. Everyone used to prefer React Native for their app development but not any longer. Flutter has been improved and Kotlin has announced itself into the competition as well.

For this article we will be comparing the new languages for the cross-platform development.

### PERFORMANCE
Both kotlin and flutter mobile app development is equally superb with some distictions. Kotlin because of its multiplatform can compile the codes and customize it to the best satisfaction of its users as good as the native apps.
Flutter allows reloading functionally thus giving a choice of selection if defferent elements are performing okay.

### LANGUAGE
The basic advantage of kotlin is that its programming language is quite similar to java and developers who have worked with java find it much easier to work. On the other hand, flutter uses dart from google. Although it is rarely used it is easier to understandand operate

### PRICE AND TESTING 
Both kotlin and flutter are free of cost but the real difference occurs in testing support. While kotlin tends to give more support on backend development, flutter works on wider testing features.

### UI SUPPORT
Kotlin multi-platform has a unique distiction of lending a freehand to the ui developer to make an app without restrictions and make a truly customized app. On the other hand, one can take the help of widgets if one is working with flutter. This also helps in customized solutions.

### PROS OF KOTLIN 
Kotlin is an sdk, so it is not necessary to shift the complete app to the platform. It is easier to learn it and design a cross-platform app by using multi-frame. Since ui creation is not restricted one has the freedom to work on any aspect of the app.
 
### CONS OF KOTLIN
Very few libraries are in hand right now as kotlin is still a fledgeling.Once date timelibrary comes situation will improve, Development cost is quite high which eventually will be dearer in the long run. App developer must be spruced up to know each platform and api to handle kotlin better.

### COMPANIES USING KOTLIN
* Chalk
* AutoDesk
* Careem
* Yandex
* Quizlet
* TouchLab
  
### PROS OF FLUTTER
Operting cost and deelopment charges are significantly lower.Hot reload functionality of flutter mobile app development is a very important proposition. Due to numerous widgets, flutter can provide customised facilities to its users.

### CONS OF FLUTTER
The language used , dart is still not familiar with all the app developers and this isquite a hindrance. The framwork size is very big and therfore the apps are much bigger in sizes which is detrimental in app development today.

### COMPANIES USING FLUTTER
* Google
* Groupon
* Square
* Ebay
* Alibaba
* The New York Times


### THE ULTIMATE WINNER
Both the languages are desinged to suit the developer needs and are considered to be the most trendy and used languages for cross-platform development. both these platforms are known to be reliable and aim at decreasing the time and expense of the app development alongside improved app performance.

Both the languages are said to be the thing of upcoming future.
