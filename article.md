# FLUTTER VS KOTLIN

Mobile application development has become an integral part of the business in the recent years. Earlier people used to prefer ReactNative or Flutter in order to develop cross-platform applications due to its low cost features but today, Kotlin has managed to enter into the world of cross-platform development. 
Everyone used to prefer React Native for their cross-platform app development but not any longer because Flutter has been improved a lot since the past years, providing better features than ReactNative and Kotlin has also announced itself into the competition as well.

For this article we will be comparing the new languages for the cross-platform development.

### PERFORMANCE
Both kotlin and flutter mobile app development is equally superb with some distinctions. Kotlin because of its multi-platform can compile the codes and customize it to the best satisfaction of its users as good as the native apps.
Flutter allows reloading functionally thus giving a choice of selection if different elements are performing okay.
According to developers, Flutter is described as the most popular cross-platform mobile framework whereas Kotlin is described as detailed statistically typed programming language.

### LANGUAGE
The basic advantage of kotlin is that its programming language is quite similar to java and developers who have worked with java find it much easier to work. On the other hand, flutter uses dart from google. Although it is rarely used it is easier to understand and operate

### PRICE AND TESTING 
Both kotlin and flutter are free of cost but the real difference occurs in testing support. While kotlin tends to give more support on backend development, flutter works on wider testing features.

### UI SUPPORT
Kotlin multi-platform has a unique distinction of lending a freehand to the ui developer to make an app without restrictions and make a truly customized app. On the other hand, one can take the help of widgets if one is working with flutter. This also helps in customized solutions.

### PROS OF KOTLIN 
Kotlin is an SDKs, so it is not necessary to shift the complete app to the platform. It is easier to learn it and design a cross-platform app by using multi-frame. Since ui creation is not restricted one has the freedom to work on any aspect of the app.
 
### CONS OF KOTLIN
Very few libraries are in hand right now as kotlin is still a fledgeling.Once date time library comes situation will improve, Development cost is quite high which eventually will be dearer in the long run. App developer must be spruced up to know each platform and api to handle kotlin better.

### COMPANIES USING KOTLIN
* Chalk
* AutoDesk
* Careem
* Yandex
* Quizlet
* TouchLab
  
### PROS OF FLUTTER
Operating cost and development charges are significantly lower. Hot reload functionality of flutter mobile app development is a very important proposition. Due to numerous widgets, flutter can provide customized facilities to its users.

### CONS OF FLUTTER
The language used , dart is still not familiar with all the app developers and this is quite a hindrance. The framework size is very big and therefore the apps are much bigger in sizes which is detrimental in app development today.

### COMPANIES USING FLUTTER
* GoogleAds - The Google Ads app helps users manage, optimize and track ad campaigns all from the convenience of an android device.

* Groupon - Groupon uses Flutter to help hundreds of thousands of merchants track campaign performance, manage customer satisfaction, and get efficient support.

* Square -  The Flutter plugin for our Square Reader SDK enables developers to build apps for merchants that take in-person payments.

* Ebay - The eBay Motors app is a powerful tool for browsing, buying, and selling vehicles directly from consumersâ€™ phones.

* Alibaba - Alibaba, the world's biggest online commerce company, used Flutter to create a beautiful app experience for iOS and Android on their Xianyu app.

* Phillips - Flutter brought intuitive controls to Philips Hue apps, allowing users to set the mood and sync their smart lights to their media quickly and easily.


### SUMMARY
Both the languages are designed to suit the developer needs and are considered to be the most trendy and used languages for cross-platform development. both these platforms are known to be reliable and aim at decreasing the time and expense of the app development alongside improved app performance.
Both the languages are said to be the thing of upcoming future.
There is no ultimate winner among the both moreover it depends on the needs and skills of the programmer. Sometimes the advantages of any framework suit best to your needs but on the other hand, those advantages can be useless for other developers if they lack the skills to use that framework.
The primary purpose of the article was to help developers distinguish the best cross-development platform for them depending as per their needs and skills.
