**April 11th - 22nd 2022** Hackathon ends on the 22nd.

In this edge-based hackathon, we will focus on Section's [Kubernetes Edge Interface (KEI)](https://www.section.io/docs/explanations/kei/) solution. [KEI](https://www.section.io/kubernetes-edge-interface/) makes many edge clusters appear as a single cluster, enabling developers to quickly and easily deploy applications across a distributed Edge.

To participate in this hackathon, EngEd students are expected to create a true Kubernetes application for the Edge that is deployed using the KEI process.

Review the judging criteria listed below.

Below you will find full details on the hackathon and any requirements.
