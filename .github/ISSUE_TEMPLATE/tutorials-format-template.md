### Tutorials Format:
To ensure the audience is getting the best experience - make sure you research other tutorials on the subject - this will help make you write a more complete and unique tutorial with a higher chance of being found and helping someone out. This also helps to narrow your focus as you research and begin to write. A bit of history about the technology being referenced or talked about might be helpful for the beginner audience.


Before starting make sure you pinpoint the problem your article is going to solve for the audience. If you are writing a tutorial, it is because you have noticed a pain point you’d like to address.
When framing your tutorial it would help to identify your audience - who is this tutorial going to be written for - and who will be reading it.
Tell the audience what a successful task looks like - and guide them through the process.
Make the tutorial as user-friendly as possible - by including screenshots, tips, code examples, anything you think would benefit the audience as they try to replicate the tutorial.
Don’t forget to get the audience involved by asking for feedback - or leave a call to action - for the reader to try out the skill they just learned about.

- Make examples concrete
- Audience should learn by doing
- Clear understanding of how to start
- Should require minimum explanation
- Immediate sense of accomplishment
