NOTE: We encourage you to reach out to your peer community to get your article reviewed for basic grammar and syntax issues before submitting to cut down on the rounds of revisions.

## Software Reviews:
### New Tech Introductions Review Format Example:
- BRIEF SUMMARY- Your tech introduction should be a self-contained topic and must be an accurate interpretation of what is presented.
- INTRODUCTION of the NEW TECHNOLOGY – a short introduction/description of the technology that is being reviewed.	 The introduction should contain all needed technical detail for the audience to replicate themselves and it should give the reader a clear understanding of how the technology works.
- POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS  of the new tech – explain how you have used this technology or how this technology may be used in the future.
- PROS & CONS– outline the advantages and disadvantages of this new technology from your own experience/point of view and support it using relevant examples and sources.
- CONCLUSION -  include any next or final steps summarizing the technology introduction - that serves as a good launchpad for the audience.


### Detailed Code Review Checklist
- Be Fair: When comparing software(s) - be sure to include both the advantages and disadvantages of the software being compared or reviewed.
- Share why you believe this review will be helpful to the community - describe your experience with the software (including extensive screenshots when applicable) - what problem did the software solve for you?
- **Test, Learn, & Test again:** - Take your time researching new interesting topics you choose to explore & ensure any included code blocks have been thoroughly tested - exactly as stated in the review - to help cut down revision time.
- Share any tips, techniques, and tricks you’ve discovered along the way, what helped you improve your coding experience - do not shy away from including details that may help the audience along the way.
- Coding best practices & proper code formatting: While writing your software review, check the code formatting to help improve readability and ensure that there are no barriers for the audience to get started.
- Non Technical requirements: (Readability is very important) the audience should get a feel of a story while reading through your software review.
