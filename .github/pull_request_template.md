### Article checklist

**ATTENTION: In your PR - add the ISSUE (topic form) # that this PR corresponds to. You can do this by also adding a comment that states **["This fixes #(enter your Idea Content Form #)"](https://youtu.be/TKJ4RdhyB5Y?t=278)** to link and close your Idea Content (issue) when the PR is merged.**
      
      
**NOTE: (Please ensure that you have only one open issue + linked pull request at a time. This will ensure that we complete the article in a timely manner from inception to publishing.)**

**If you have not already please go over our [Resources Page](https://github.com/section-engineering-education/engineering-education/blob/master/new_contributors/resources-page.md) for more tips and tricks on how to improve our overall technical writing.**
