## How Much Data is on the Internet?

Everyday we are generating over 2.5 quintillion or 2.5 exabytes of data. This number is also increasing, with estimates that by 2025, 463 exabytes of data will be created each day. While not all of this is ever put onto the internet, much of this is expected to make its way onto the internet at least for a moment.

To visualize this amount of data, think about a byte as being as a big as a United States Quarter. A Quarter has a diameter of 0.955 inches, therefore having a surface area of pi * radius squared which is about 0.716 square inches. Therefore, 2.5 exabytes is equal to 2.5 quintillion quarters (or about 625 quadrillion US dollars). If you lay out quarter flat like the following, you can fit 182 quarter per square foot. This means that 2.5 quintillion quarters will cover the State of Texas a little under 1,834.5 times, and this is being generated everyday on the internet.

### How is All This Data Stored?

All of this data is stored between Hard Drives, Magnetic Tapes, and Solid State Drives. Each of these drives have a different maximum capacity, Hard Drives currently have a maximum capacity of 16Tb (3.5" drive), Magnetic Tape Drives hold 12Tb native and 30Tb compressed , and Solid State Drives can hold up to 15.3Tb (2.5" drive).

Assuming we are storing all of the data that we generate per day on the 16Tb drives, it would take 156,250 drive. That many would take up about 2156.576 cubic feet. This would only fill up an Olympic swimming pool about 2.4434%, not including the necessary components like motherboard, cables, processor, and RAM. 

### Measuring the Internet

While these numbers are mostly an estimate on how much data we are producing are hard to know (since a large part of the internet is hidden, which may include server log files and other hidden information), we can estimate based upon what we know about the internet. 

According to [Live-Counter](https://www.live-coutner.com/how-big-is-the-internet), the size of the Internet double roughly every two years. We also know that the amount of data on the internet was 3.7 Zettabytes or 3,700 exabytes in 2013. That means that, assuming the data on the internet does double every two years and not faster nor slower, we are looking at an amazing 97.433 Zettabytes of data on the internet. Which assuming are are still using 16Tb 3.5 inch drives, would fill up 952.25 Olympic swimming pools. 

With this astounding amount of data on the internet how much will you add today?
