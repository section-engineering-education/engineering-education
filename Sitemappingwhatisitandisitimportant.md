## Sitemapping, What Is It and Is It Important
Sitemapping is by definition create a map that describes relations between pages of a website. Most websites have a sitemap, but not many people see, use, or even know about it. This raises the question: what is a sitemap and is it important?

### What Is A Sitemap?
According to [Google Search Console](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/156184?hl=en), a sitemap is a file that provides you with information about the page, videos, and other files on a website and the relationships between such items. Search engines read the sitemap to intelligently crawl a website. 

A sitemap can be formatted using many different forms. The most common formats are XML followed by RSS and then Text. Both of the formats are easily created as outlined on [Google Search Console Help website](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/183668?hl=en).  Companies that run search engines, like Google, DuckDuckGo, or Bing will use a sitemap to help generate more accurate search results.

### Is It Important?
Sitemaps are commonly used by search engines to crawl a website more intelligently and various other information. This information can be extremely important in determining the correct search results. By providing a search engine access to a correct sitemap, the search engine and crawl more pages of a website, as it would usually find new pages to crawl using backlinks, but not all webpages have many backlinks. If a page does not have many backlinks and no sitemap, it may never be found by a search engine.

Not only can sitemaps be useful for search engines to index a website, it can be very useful for development. For example, when developing a site with a user login system, it may be important to create a sitemap to view how pages are connected and which pages can only be accessed by logging in. Viewing this information may help in development to make sure that links do not accidentally take a visitor to a "protected page" that was not for their viewing.

According to [NeilPatel](https://neilpatel.com/blog/build-a-sitemap/), "Without a sitemap, you may spend a lot of time creating unnecessary pages, or designing sites that are more complicated than they need to be." Instead of possibly wasting time creating duplicate resources for a website it is better to create a sitemap and use it as a roadmap. 

Planning, designing, and creating a program to achieve a specific goal takes time. Some of the time may be accidentally spent duplicating systems that already exist within the program. Sitemapping can help prevent this duplication when creating a web application. But, always remember to think ahead when planning any type of program, especially a website.
