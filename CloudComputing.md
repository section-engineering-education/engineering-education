# An Intro To Cloud Computing

Before we go into describing cloud computing, let’s go on a throwback to how things were before cloud computing came around. Back then to set up an app you do that on some specific occasions, get some hardware and software components, use professionals to run and control these servers and as the number of guests to your site expands you get to purchase more resources, use more people and even have to buy or rent a warehouse to hosting your server is Hella stressful, right?

So sometimes in the 90s, cloud computing was conceived, and the idea was to move all these components (storage, compute resources, etc) to the internet. And that was how it all started till it grew to what we have now and we are still growing. 

So, from that brief history lesson, According to *Microsoft Azure* we can define **cloud computing** as the delivery of computing services like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence -over the internet (*‘the cloud’*) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources & economies of scale... does that make sense?

## Benefits of cloud computing

Cloud computing offers many benefits. Here are common reasons organizations are turning to cloud computing services:

* **Cost:** Organizations don't have to spend a massive amount of money to buy hardware. Cloud computing also cuts costs related to downtime. Since downtime rarely happens in cloud computing, companies don't have to spend time and money to fix any issues that may be related to downtime. 

* **Pay per-use:** Users get to pay for only the resources and workload that they use
Broad Network Access: A user with access can get or upload data to the cloud from anywhere with an internet connection using any device.

* **Multi-tenancy:** Many customers share the same physical infrastructure, yet they still have privacy and security over their data.

* **Resource pooling:** Allows customers to share the same physical resources.

* **Reliability:** Cloud computing allows data backup, disaster recovery. Also, data can be at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider’s network. 

## Types of cloud computing

First, you need to determine the cloud computing architecture, that we will implement our cloud services on. There are three distinct ways to deploy cloud services: on a public cloud, private cloud, or hybrid cloud. Each has its advantages and disadvantages and which one you (or your business) choose will depend on your data and the level of security and management you need:

* **Public Cloud:** It delivers computing resources like servers and storage over the Internet. An example is Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure. All hardware, software, and other supporting infrastructure is owned and managed by the cloud provider. You access these services and manage your account using a web browser.

* **Private Cloud:** Here, computing resources are governed, owned, and operated by a single organization. A private cloud is one in which we maintain the services and infrastructure on a private network.

* **Hybrid Cloud:** This is the combination of public cloud and private cloud. A hybrid cloud gives your business greater flexibility, more deployment options, and helps optimize your existing infrastructure, security, and compliance.

## Types of Cloud Services

Cloud services come in three primary service models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

* **IaaS**: It provides access to computing resources in a virtualized environment “the cloud” on the internet. It provides computing infrastructure like virtual server space, network connections, bandwidth, load balancers, and IP addresses. The pool of hardware resources is extracted from multiple servers and networks usually distributed across many data centers. This provides redundancy and reliability to IaaS.

Popular IaaS providers include:

   * Amazon Web Services (AWS)
   * Microsoft Azure
   * Google Compute Engine (GCE), the IaaS component of Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

* **PaaS:** It provides a platform and environment to allow developers to build applications and services. This service is hosted in the cloud and accessed by the users via the internet. Users access these tools over the internet using APIs, web portals, or gateway software. It provides a platform to support application development. It includes software support and management services, storage, networking, deploying, testing, collaborating, hosting, and maintaining applications. An example is Heroku.

* **SaaS:** It delivers software applications over the internet; these applications are often called web services. With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure and handle any maintenance, like software upgrades and security patching. An example of a SaaS application is Microsoft Office 365 for productivity and email services.

## Wrap Up

Because of competition, cloud providers constantly expand their services to differentiate their services. This has led public IaaS providers to offer far more than common compute and storage instances.

For example, serverless, or event-driven computing is a cloud service that executes specific functions, such as image processing and database updates.

With serverless computing, developers create code, and the cloud provider loads and executes that code in response to real-world events, so users don’t have to worry about the server or instance aspect of the cloud deployment.
