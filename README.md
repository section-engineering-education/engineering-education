### Program Purpose
Our program was created to promote and cultivate relevant career building/skill enrichment resources, a community for students to share their knowledge with peers around the world, and to help catapult their careers.”

Our community content can be found at [https://section.io/engineering-education](https://section.io/engineering-education).

The Section team will monitor and manage the overall Program.

### Program Requirements
Section partners with university computer science programs across the globe to create a community which is useful for engineers of every (any) level preparing to enter the DEV workforce.

To join the program, we ask that students be part of a university level CS class or program.

### Program Resources
- Be sure to sign up to the Section Community Slack Channel at [slack.section.io](https://sectionio-community.slack.com/). Once signed up, join the **#eng-ed** channel for ongoing program communications.

### EngEd Community Contribution Initiative
One of our main goals for the EngEd community is to provide students/contributors a friendly and inviting place to contribute to real-world projects to help students better build up their professional portfolios and profiles (upon entering the DEV career space). We would like to allow our EngEd community the opportunity to increase and build upon the skills they have by allowing them to help build the features/enhancements the community members want to see in the EngEd program. This Contribution Initiative is strictly restricted to the EngEd community.  

### EngEd Community Contribution Submission Process
1. To submit an EngEd feature contribution for consideration, be sure to first check [past feature suggestons](https://github.com/section-engineering-education/engineering-education/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement) to ensure relevance and prevent overlap. **Hint**: Use the this EngEd Content Suggestion form to propose article topic for approval and get feedback on topic ideas. [*View content form here*](https://github.com/section-engineering-education/engineering-education/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=enged-feature-suggestion.md&title=Feature+suggestion)
2. When you're ready to submit a suggestion for review, submit your issue with details on what you would like to see added to the EngEd application/program. 
3. Suggestions will be reviewed by the Section team for relevance, and quality. 
4. Once suggested features have been incorporated into our backlog, the Section team will approve your issue and create a pull request to be worked on by the EngEd community.

### EngEd Article Submission Process
We also have an EngEd Article Submission Process that allows our contributors to submit (and publish) a community-generated pool of content which is valuable for engineers of every (any) level.

This is in an effort to provide students a medium to showcase their skills, profiles, and contributed works to any potential employers. 

Students are expected to contribute fully polished and ready to be published (by *fully polished and ready to be published articles* we mean pull request that are submitted in FINAL form draft. Pull requests that require **moderate to major review/revision will either be CLOSED or will not recieve payout upon being published**) articles will be eligible to recieve payouts. 

### Submission Instructions
