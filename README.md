# Relevancy of Quantum Cryptography in the future

Encryption is a part of everyday life. It provides protection to everything from emails to bank accounts. With quantum computing becoming a viable way information may become more vulnerable to hacking and intrusions. Therefore it is all the more important to know about quantum encryption, lets dive into the basics. 

## What is Quantum Computing

Let’s first start by defining [quantum computing](https://www.ted.com/talks/shohini_ghose_a_beginner_s_guide_to_quantum_computing/discussion#t-564536). Quantum computing is amazing in that it operates from something called a qubit. These qubits can demonstrate multiple states of existence at the same time until the point it is measured, where it can only provide one state of existence as an answer. If this is a bit difficult to conceive, it is a bit easier to imagine a qubit on a spectrum. If the bit were to exist in between the one and the zero it could have 20 percent zero and 80 percent one, or any mixture of chances. 

In terms of processing, a computer would test every possibility individually and a quantum computer would test every possibility at the same time with these mixtures of chances. Much like trying chocolate-vanilla combination ice cream and discerning that one likes the vanilla more than the chocolate, rather the computer would try each flavor individually. By comparison, a few  qubit sput together have enough processing power to solve a problem instantaneously that would take some computers thousands of years to solve. In addition to this processesing capacaity, it would be able a large majority solve all math-based encryptions that are currently used today in a short matter of time.

## Why use Quantum Computing

Cryptography is the art of scrambling data, typically text or images, with enough random numbers that data can’t be read without the key to access the information. In reality, these encryptions are hardly random but rather they are sequences or fake random numbers. Every day that more research about quantum computing is gained there is a chance that a hacking system will find a way to break every encryption and access all data by instantaneously solving these sequences. By including quantum encryption, it adds an extra dimension where the numbers can truly be random. The quantum encryption then takes on the properties of the quantum particle such as having multiple states of existence and not being able to measure it without disturbing the particle. It is practically un-hackable since any interference from hackers would change the state of the particle and therefore make it unmeasurable and incapable of replicating.

## How Quantum Cryptography works

The process for current [Quantum Cryptography](https://quantumxc.com/quantum-cryptography-explained/), also known as quantum key distribution, sends photons through fiber optic cables in an ordered a sequence. The sequence of photons passes through a polarizer that randomizes the orientation of the photon and sent to the receiver. A receiver only accepts the photons of a certain orientation and disregards the rest. These photons are then accepted as the key matching to the encrypted data. As 

## Limitations

While quantum cryptography is theoretically un-hackable it is still limited, and the transfer of data is still constrained to the physical requirements. Any network that transfers data uses relays and repeaters which are vulnerable to tampering. Additionally, this concept is still highly theoretical and new ways to exploit quantum cryptography are still in the early stages of testing. Whatever the case, quantum cryptography will become an essential part of data encryption in a number of years.
