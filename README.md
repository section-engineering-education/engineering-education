### Program Purpose
Section partners with university computer science programs across the globe to create a community-generated pool of content which is useful for engineers of every (any) level.

Content can be found at [https://section.io/engineering-education](https://section.io/engineering-education).

The Section team will monitor and manage the overall Program.
