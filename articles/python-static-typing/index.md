Python is a dynamically typed language. One does not have to explicitly indicate the data type and return types of your variables and functions, respectively. Dynamic typing makes Python very user-friendly. However, dynamic typing has no compiler verified documentation and may lead to runtime errors that are difficult to fix. Static typing provides a solution to these problems.

In this article will go over how to perform static typing in Python and handle both variable and function annotations. You will need to have a basic understanding of Python to follow along. You will also need to install [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for type checking.

### 1. Introduction to type annotations
Type annotations is a new feature added by [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) to Python version 3.5 and above. They give the code reader hints on the return type of variable or function. Type annotations can be performed on variables and functions as well.

### 2. Variable annotations
We achieve variable annotation by adding a semicolon and the type after declaring or initializing a variable. i.e `: <type>`. Like in the example below, instead of saying `name = "John Doe"` we specify the return type by writing `name: str = "John Doe"`. One can find the output of this code [here](https://repl.it/@jerimkaura/static-typing#main.py).

```python
name: str = "John Doe"
print("Output 1: "+ str(name))
```

The output can be found [here as Output 1](https://repl.it/@jerimkaura/static-typing#main.py):

```bash
Output 1: John Doe
```

You will notice that the output is the same as `name = "John Doe"`. However, we are going to find out why the latter is recommended.

### 3. Function annotations
This is achieved by adding a forward arrow indicating the function parameters' expected return type after the function parameters' closing bracket. i.e `-> <return type>`.

```python
def square(x: int) -> int:
    return x * x
print(square(6))
```

The output can be found [here](https://repl.it/@jerimkaura/static-typing#main.py) as Output: 2.

```bash
36
```

### 4. Selected annotations in the Python 'Typing' module
Here we will look at some of the most commonly used annotations in the Python Typing module.

### 4.1. Callable
We use a Callable when one function is an argument of another. The code below demonstrates how to use `Callable`, we are writing a function to call the `square()` function for every member of a list.

```python
from typing import Callable, List
# The square integers
def square(x: int) -> int:
    return x*x
# implementing callable. square() function passed as an argument
def square_list_members(get_square: Callable, list: List) -> List[int]:
    return [get_square(num) for num in list]
# print output
print(square_list_members(square, range(10,20)))
```

Output:

```bash
[100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361]
```

You can confirm the output [here](https://repl.it/@jerimkaura/static-typing#main.py) as output 3.

### 4.2. List
`numbers: List[int] = []` informs the type checker that numbers is a list if integers. `def even_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:` indicates that the function returns a list of integers. 

The code output is a list of even number between 100 and 120. [Here](https://repl.it/@jerimkaura/static-typing#main.py) is the output as `Output 4:`

```python
# List as a varible
numbers: List[int] = []
# List as a return type of a function
from typing import List
def even_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # list compression
    numbers = [number for number in numbers if number % 2 == 0]
    # return even numbers in the list arguments
    return numbers
print(even_numbers(range(100, 150)))
```

```python
[100, 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120]
```

### 4.3. Dict & any

```python
from typing import Callable, Dict, Any
# The square integers
def square(x: int) -> int:
    return x*x
# implementing  Dict, the key can be of any type
def square_dictionary_values(get_square: Callable, dictionary: Dict[Any, int]) -> Dict[Any, int]:
    return {key: get_square(value) for key, value in dictionary.items()}
# print output
print(square_dictionary_values(square, {'one':1, 'two': 2, 'three':3, 'four': 4, 'five': 5}))
```

You can find the output [here](https://repl.it/@jerimkaura/static-typing#main.py) as `Output 5`.

```python
{'one': 1, 'two': 4, 'three': 9, 'four': 16, 'five': 25} 
```

The type checker treats `Any` as compatible with any data type. We can perform any operation or method call on `Any`.

### 4.4. Union
Union is used when a function has more than one return type. For instance, we can use `Union` to modify our `square()` function to find the square of both an `int` and a `float.`

```python
from typing import Union, List
# The square function
def square(list:List) -> Union[int, float]:
    # empty list
    square_list:List = []
    # square each element of the list and append it to the square_list
    for element in list:
        new: Union[int, float] = element * element
        square_list.append(new)
    return square_list
# pinting output
print(square([12.9, 5, 2.1, 8, 4, 6.5]))
```

Th output is [here](https://repl.it/@jerimkaura/static-typing#main.py) as `Output 6`

```python
[166.41, 25, 4.41, 64, 16, 42.25]
```

### 5. Using mypy static type checker
Here is where we are going to understand the relevance of static typing.

First, we install `mypy`.

```python
$ pip install mypy-lang
```

We will do type checking using our `square()` function. When we change the return value of the function to a string `Hello There`.

```python
from typing import Union, List
# The square function
def square(list: List) -> Union[int, float]:
    # empty list
    square_list: List = []
    # square each element of the list and append it to the square_list
    for element in list:
        new: Union[int, float] = element * element
        square_list.append(new)
    #return value of the function is a string
    return 'Hello There'
# pinting output
print(square([12.9, 5, 2.1, 8, 4, 6.5]))
```

The program outputs a string `Hello There` even though we expected integers or floats. You will notice that this program ran successfully without errors. 

Let's use `mypy` to type-check out code for errors. To check a piece of code using mypy, run `mypy filename.py` in your code's directory.

Run the code and check the output in the following [repl](https://repl.it/@jerimkaura/static-typing#main.py) terminal [here](https://repl.it/@jerimkaura/static-typing#test.py).


Output:

```python
mypy code.py
test.py:7: error: Incompatible return value type (got "str", expected "Union[int, float]")
Found 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)
```

When we correct the error by defining a valid return type of the variables and the function, `mypy` gives a success output showing that the program passed type-checking successfully as shown [here](https://repl.it/@jerimkaura/static-typing#my_py.py).

```python
from typing import Union, List
# The square function
def square(list: List) -> List[Union[int, float]]:
    #square_list will accept both integers & floats
    square_list: List[Union[int, float]] = []
    for element in list:
        new: Union[int, float] = element * element
        square_list.append(new)
    return square_list
print(square([12.9, 5, 2.1, 8, 4, 6.5]))
```

Output:

```python
$ mypy code.py
Success: no issues found in 1 source file
```

As you can see, with static typing we can use the type checker to determine errors in our code.

### 5. Conclusion
Type hinting is a useful feature in Python. It helps you identify bugs and maintain a clean record. In this tutorial, you've learned the basics of using type hints and how they can be added to cod using annotations. 

You also had an introduction on using mypy as a static type checker. You can go ahead and dig deeper into [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) and the [Mypy documentation](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for more information.
