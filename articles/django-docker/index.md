[Docker](https://docs.docker.com) is a containerization platform that makes it possible to build, ship, and run distributed applications in controlled environments with defined rules.
<!--more-->
### Prerequisites
1. Have [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or newer installed on your computer.
2. Get Python package manager, [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) installed on your computer.
3. You will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) installed on your computer.

For Docker installation, setup, and a quick start, visit [Getting started with Docker](/engineering-education/getting-started-with-docker/).

### Project setup
We will be creating a Docker image for the Todo application that we created in [this](/engineering-education/django-crud-api/) tutorial. The `Todo` application that allows us to `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete` Todo items via a REST API.

Ensure `virtualenv` is installed on your computer by executing the command below.

```bash
$ virtualenv --version
virtualenv 20.2.2 from /home/username/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/virtualenv/__init__.py
```

If you get an error executing the command above, run the command below to install `virtualenv` on your computer.

```bash
$ pip install virtualenv
```

Create a working directory for the project by executing the command below.
```bash
$ mkdir todo
$ cd todo
```

Create a virtual environment for our project using the `virtualenv` module that we just installed. Execute the command below to create and activate the virtual environment.
```bash
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

In the working directory, clone the project from Github to your computer using the command below.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/paulodhiambo/django_todo.git
```

Move into the project directory by executing the command below.
```bash
$ cd django_todo
```

Execute the command below to install all the required dependencies for the project to run.

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the application to verify that nothing is broken and the application runs without errors.
```bash
$ ./manage.py runserver
```

Below is the project structure.
```bash
└── django_todo         # < project root package
    ├── todo             # < todo app
    │   ├── admin.py
    │   ├── apps.py
    │   ├── migrations
    │   ├── models.py
    │   ├── serializers.py
    │   ├── urls.py
    │   └── views.py
    ├── manage.py  
    ├── requirements.txt    # < Django dependencies list
    └── django_todo    
        ├── settings.py # Django settings file
        ├── urls.py
        └── wsgi.py
```

### Creating a Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions on how the Docker image will be built. A Dockerfile contains the directives below.
- **FROM**: directive sets the base image from which the Docker container will be built.
- **WORKDIR**: directive sets the working directory in the image created.
- **RUN**: directive executes commands in the container. 
- **COPY**: directive copies files from the file system into the container.
- **CMD**: directive sets the executable commands within the container.

In the root project directory, create a file with the name `Dockerfile` with no file extension.
In the `Dockerfile` created above, add the code below.

```Docker
# pull the official base image
FROM python:3.8.3-alpine

# set work directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# set environment variables
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1

# install dependencies
RUN pip install --upgrade pip 
COPY ./requirements.txt /usr/src/app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# copy project
COPY . /usr/src/app

EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["python", "manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
```

- `FROM python:3.8.3-alpine` sets the base image from which the Docker container will be created.
- `WORKDIR /usr/src/app` sets the working directory inside the container to `/usr/src/app`.
- `ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1` prevents Python from copying pyc files to the container.
- `ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1` ensures that Python output is logged to the terminal, making it possible to monitor Django logs in realtime.
- `RUN pip install --upgrade pip ` installs and upgrades the pip version that is in the container.
- `COPY ./requirements.txt /usr/src/app` copies the `requirements.txt` file into the work directory in the container.
- `RUN pip install -r requirements.txt`
 installs all the required modules for the `django_todo` application to run in the container.
- `COPY . /usr/src/app` copies all the project source code to the working directory in the container.
- `EXPOSE 8000` exposes port 8000 for access from other applications.
- `CMD ["python", "manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8000"]` sets the executable commands in the container.

### Building the Docker image
To build the Docker image from the Dockerfile we created above, execute the command below.

```bash
$ docker build --tag django_todo:latest .
```

- `--tag` sets the tag for the image. For example, we are creating a Docker image from `python:3.8.3` that has the tag `alpine`. In our Docker image, `latest` is the tag set.
- The trailing `.` indicates that the `Dockerfile` is within the current working directory.
  
To list all the available images on your computer, execute the command below.
```bash
$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY    TAG            IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
django_todo   latest         6e06c89267f1   3 hours ago     147MB
todo          latest         b10c177c6d58   4 hours ago     162MB
<none>        <none>         2f418d359923   4 hours ago     162MB
centos        latest         300e315adb2f   3 weeks ago     209MB
python        3.8.3-alpine   8ecf5a48c789   6 months ago    78.9MB
hello-world   latest         bf756fb1ae65   12 months ago   13.3kB

```

From the above list, we see the `django_todo` image that we have created.

### Creating and running the Docker Container
To build and run a Docker container from the Docker image we created above, run the command below.

```bash
$ docker run --name django_todo -d -p 8000:8000 django_todo:latest
```
- `--name` sets the name of the Docker container.
- `-d` makes the image run in detached mode. The image is capable of running in the background.
- `-p 8000:8000` maps port 8000 in the Docker container to port 8000 in localhost.
- `django_todo: latest` specifies which image is used to build the Docker container. 

To list all the running Docker containers, execute the command below.
```bash
$ docker container ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS       PORTS                    NAMES
d73306a9fb04   django_todo:latest   "python manage.py ru…"   3 hours ago   Up 3 hours   0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp   django_todo
```

1. On your browser visit `localhost` on port 8000 to confirm if the `django_todo` application is running in the container.

### Publishing the Docker image to Docker Hub
![Docker Hub image](/engineering-education/django-docker/docker_create.png)

Docker Hub is a repository of container images that can be used to create Docker containers.

Visit [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and create an account if you don't have one.

Once you have created an account and logged in to Docker Hub, create a repository with the name `django_todo` and the description `Django Docker Image`.

Now that we have created a repository in Docker Hub, to push the Docker image to the repository we have created we execute the command below.

```bash
$ docker login

$ docker tag django_todo:latest <Docker Hub username>/django_todo:latest

$ docker push <Docker Hub username>/django_todo:latest
```

- `docker login` command logs you into your Docker Hub account on the command line, making it possible to push Docker images to Docker Hub.
- `docker tag django_todo: latest <Docker Hub username>/django_todo: latest` command modifies the tag of our local Docker image to include the Docker Hub username.
- `docker push <Docker Hub username>/django_todo: latest` pushes the image to Docker Hub repository we created earlier.

**Note:** Replace `<Docker Hub username>` with your actual Docker Hub username.

The full source code for the application is in [this](https://github.com/paulodhiambo/django_todo/tree/token_auth) GitHub repository.

### Conclusion
Docker is a great tool for packaging applications with the required dependencies to run them both locally and in production. [Docker playground](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) is an online playground that you can use to test various Docker commands without installing Docker locally on your computer.

Happy Coding!
