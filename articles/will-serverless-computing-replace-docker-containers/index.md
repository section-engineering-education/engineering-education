### Introduction
[Serverless computing](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/what-is-serverless/) refers to systems that allow an organization to execute a specific piece of code as and when required. It is called serverless because the organization does not need to install and service a physical or virtual server to run the system. 

In the modern technology world, serverless computing has become a topic of discussion and a key area of concern as many organizations are adopting it.

Modern platforms such as [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/), [AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html), and [Fission.io](https://fission.io/) ensure serverless computing readily available to organizations today.

Most technological blogs and forums are discussing serverless computing technology significantly more than [Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container).

Regardless of what both names suggest, serverless computing is not serverless, and Docker containers do not contain anything. It may not sound straightforward, but in this article, we will cover each in detail.

### Understanding Serverless Computing?
Serverless computing has gone through a significant improvement over time. Earlier, for the [application deployments](https://enterprise-architecture.org/docs/application_architecture/application_deployments/), the server's computing resources were assumed as a recurring fixed cost. It meant that the organization had to pay for the computing resources regardless of the amount of work performed by the server.

Once an organization decides to go serverless, it only pays for what is used on the [cloud](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-the-cloud/) and will not be charged for any other costs associated with server downtime.

Serverless computing works the same as the Function-as-a-Service ([FaaS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/glossary/function-as-a-service-faas/)) platform, enabling an organization to manage its budget better. This cost factor has been its most significant selling point.

Another advantage of serverless is that the organization pays for what they utilize and can still use the server to deploy and run other applications.

The cost factor is dependent on the below parameters:
- The  duration of the script
- The number of requests
- The memory required for the function

The cost of ownership of serverless is the same as that of [Virtual Machines](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/virtual-machine) (VMs). However, with Virtual Machines, the enterprise needs to keep it running before the function request is placed. That creates an element of waste when the capacity is not fully utilized.

So the above approach ends up more costly compared to that of serverless computing. The serverless model does away with the issue since it can scale immediately on request. It means that once the function request is configured, the process is done.

### Understanding Docker Containers
Docker container refers to the software that is packaged into standardized units for development, shipment, and deployment. In addition, a [container image](https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/definition/container-image) is a stand-alone, lightweight, and executable software package equipped with all it needs to execute.

It means that a container image package contains the below:
- Runtime
- Code
- Settings
- System libraries
- System tools

Since Docker containers can run applications made for Windows and Linux-based operating systems, the containerized software will execute the same way regardless of the platform. If an organization decides to use containers, it reduces the conflicts between the teams using different software hosted on the same infrastructure by separating the development and [staging environment](https://umbraco.com/about-us/umbraco-dictionary/staging-environment/).

### Comparisons between Serverless Computing and Docker Containers
Serverless computing and Docker containers have little in common. The reason is that both technologies are not the same since they do not serve the same needs.

The common benefits include:
- Minimum overhead
- High performance
- Requires minimum infrastructure provisioning

It is not possible to compare the two platforms since they solve different computing problems. For instance, serverless is best suited for new applications since it is challenging to write, re-write or even refactor applications as sets of [serverless functions](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/serverless-functions). Serverless computing platforms such as AWS Lambda also come equipped with in-built constraints on the time available for functions to execute, the function size, and memory usage.

It can also be challenging to utilize several [monitoring tools](https://lumigo.io/serverless-monitoring-guide/) using serverless functions since it cannot access the container management system of the function's container. It will restrict one from conducting performance analysis and makes debugging difficult.

Serverless computing requires one to keep the functions as small as possible to restrict them from using huge system resources. The approach is essential, especially when restricting a small number of high-end users from overloading the whole system and locking everyone else out.

Serverless is not the best with performance as the speed and response time continuously vary. The approach has a small list of supported native programming languages. It is not that much essential to serverless computing on a fundamental level but still a reflection of the system's weakness.

Conversely, Docker container-based applications can be huge, complex, and can containerize existing applications.  Although there might be the need to engage in refactoring, it is not as much as it will be with a serverless computing platform.

The container-based deployments can control individual containers, virtualized infrastructure, and the overall system completely. It enables one to allocate better and manage resources, set the policies, and enhance security control.

Complete control over the Docker container platform allows one to understand what is going on in the containers. It makes debugging and analysis easy, as access to all the resources, and in-depth performance monitoring can be performed at all levels.

It means that one can analyze each problem and tweak it on a [microservices](https://microservices.io/) basis better to meet the unique performance requirements of the system. Since the whole system can be checked, it is easier to perform full analytics at all levels.

### Will Serverless Computing replace Docker Containers?
In the real world, serverless computing and Docker containers work well when deployed to work together.

A container-based platform is the better choice for substantial complex applications and application suites in a large enterprise or internet-based environment.

Serverless computing is best suited for independent tasks. The tasks can be accessed by outside services or run in the background.

Both serverless and Docker functions well together. Docker-container-based systems forward tasks to serverless applications and avoid tying up the resources of the primary application.

### Conclusion
Serverless and containers support each other.  Serverless hides out the complexity of the container from the programming model. Also, serverless cannot exist without physical infrastructure, virtual machines, and containers.

The buzz about serverless computing will one day replace Docker containers is baseless and cannot be justified. Many technology blogs and forums may argue the opposite, but the fact remains that container-based serverless computing will be the future of technology.
