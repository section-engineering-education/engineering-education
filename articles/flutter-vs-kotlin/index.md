# FLUTTER VS KOTLIN

Mobile application development has become an integral part of the business in recent years. Previously, people used to prefer ReactNative or Flutter to develop cross-platform applications due to their low-cost features. But today, Kotlin has managed to enter into the world of cross-platform development. 

Everyone used to prefer React Native for their cross-platform app development but not any longer. Because Flutter has been improved a lot since the past years, it now provides better features than ReactNative. And Kotlin has entered the competition as well.

For this article, we will be comparing the new languages for cross-platform development. The primary purpose of the article was to help developers distinguish the best cross-development platform for them, depending on their needs and skills.

### PERFORMANCE

For both Kotlin and Flutter, mobile app development is superb with some distinctions. Kotlin can compile the codes and customize it to the best satisfaction of its users as well as the native apps. 

Flutter allows reloading functionality, giving a choice of selection if all the different elements are performing okay. 

Developers describe Flutter as the most popular cross-platform mobile framework. Kotlin, however, is described as a statistical-type programming language.

### LANGUAGE

The main advantage of Kotlin is that its programming language is quite similar to Java. Developers who have worked with Java find it much easier to work with Kotlin. On the other hand, Flutter uses Dart from Google. Although Dart is remarkably used, it is easier to understand and operate.

### PRICE AND TESTING 

Both Kotlin and Flutter are free, but the real difference occurs in testing support. While Kotlin tends to support backend development, Flutter works on extensive testing features.

### UI SUPPORT

Kotlin multi-platform has a unique distinction of lending a freehand to the UI developer to make an app without restrictions and make a truly customized app. On the other hand, Developers can take the help of widgets if they are working with Flutter, which also helps in customized solutions.

### PROS OF KOTLIN 

Kotlin is an SDKs, so it is not necessary to shift the complete app to the platform. It is easier to learn it and design a cross-platform app by using a multi-frame. Since UI creation is not restricted, Developers have the freedom to work on any aspect of the app.

### CONS OF KOTLIN

Very few libraries have the platform in hand right now as Kotlin is still a fledgling. Once the date-time library comes, the situation will improve. The development cost is quite high, and it will eventually be dearer in the long run. The app developer must have highly developed skills to understand each platform and use API to handle Kotlin better.

### COMPANIES USING KOTLIN

* Chalk

* AutoDesk

* Careem

* Yandex

* Quizlet

* TouchLab

### PROS OF FLUTTER

The operating cost and development charges of Flutter are significantly lower than Kotlin. Hot reload functionality of Flutter mobile app development is an important feature. Due to many widgets, Flutter can provide customized facilities to its users.

### CONS OF FLUTTER

The language used in Dart is still not familiar to all the app developers, and this is quite a hindrance. The framework size of Dart is quite large. Thus, the apps are much bigger, which is detrimental to app development in Flutter today.

### COMPANIES USING FLUTTER

* GoogleAds - The Google Ads app helps users manage, optimize, and track ad campaigns all from the convenience of an android device.

* Groupon - Groupon uses Flutter to help hundreds of thousands of merchants track campaign performance, manage customer satisfaction, and get efficient support.

* Square - The Flutter plugin for our Square Reader SDK enables developers to build apps for merchants that take in-person payments.

* eBay - The eBay Motors app is a powerful tool for browsing, buying, and selling vehicles directly from consumer's phones.

* Alibaba - Alibaba, the world's biggest online commerce company, used Flutter to create a beautiful app experience for iOS and Android on their Xianyu app.

* Phillips - Flutter brought intuitive controls to Philips Hue apps, allowing users to set the mood and sync their smart lights to their media quickly and easily.

### SUMMARY

Both languages are designed to suit the developer's needs and are the most used languages for cross-platform development. Both these platforms are known to be reliable. They aim at decreasing the time and expense of the app development and offer improved app performance.

Both languages are said to be the hottest up-and-coming developments of the mobile application industry.

There is no ultimate winner between both languages. But, it depends on the needs and skills of the programmer. Sometimes the advantages of any framework best suit developers' needs. But, those advantages can be useless for other developers if they lack the skills.
