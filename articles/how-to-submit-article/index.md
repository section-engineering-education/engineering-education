One of the most fundamental part of contributing to **"Open-Source Projects"** is working as a group and handling a large number of files, with every development stage. Here, in **Section**, the whole process runs on a very smooth and well-mannered structure. Today, I'll be guiding you with a walkthrough to get a better understanding for submitting your first article in Section.

-  I've always been a believer of learning things by actually doing them. The more I make mistakes, more I get to learn. The idea of this blog post originated after I faced several difficulties in submitting my first article itself.

- This guide includes step-by-step instructions and all the extensive information at one place, so that you have a comfortable experience in beginning your Open Source contribution journey. Without further ado, let's get started by answering all the **Why(s), What(s) & How(s)!**

### A Complete Roadmap

#### Step 1: So, I have my article ready. What should I do now to submit it?

- Apart from all the traditional ways of doing things, there exists yet another simple but efficient method to do same work with increased productivity. Technology aiding another technology has been one of the important feature of modern era. On similar lines, we'll be using following tools to ease the process:

    - [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
    - *Text Editor* like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/)

- Assuming, you have a working Github Account (which is necessary for contributing in Engineering Education's Programme) and your article content in **'.md'** format, we are all ready & good to go for uploading your first article.

### Tips:
- You get more brownie points by submitting articles in '.md' format. Markdown (.md) is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document, formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.

### Step 2: Forking the Section Repository

![Fork Image](/engineering-education/how-to-submit-your-first-article/fork.png)

- After setting up the workspace successfully, open [Section github repository](https://github.com/section-io/engineering-education) on your web browser. You'll be seeing a Master GitHub repo with few boiler files. Click the **Fork** option in the upper right-hand corner (below your user account display).

![Fork Image 2](/engineering-education/how-to-submit-your-first-article/fork2.png)

- Once you clicked that option, a pop-up will come. You need to give permission to forked the repository contents in your GitHub account (See image for reference).

- If the forking process went well without an error, you'll be able to see your GitHub username in the upper left-hand corner. Now, if you have previously forked the same repository for your article, you can start from there as well.

### Step 3: Cloning the forked repository

![Clone Image](/engineering-education/how-to-submit-your-first-article/clone.png)

- Now, you will be able to see a green-colored **Clone** option. You need to clone your repository using that button in to your local machine. After clicking "Clone", select **Open in Desktop**. This will automatically direct you to the Github Desktop's Window.

![Publish PR Image](/engineering-education/how-to-submit-your-first-article/publishPR.png)

- After creating a new branch, give it a suitable name. On Github Desktop window, choose "Open in Visual Studio Code". This will take you to the VS Code Window where you will be able to add, edit & save your work.

![VS Code Image](/engineering-education/how-to-submit-your-first-article/vscode.png)

- In VS Code, you'll be seeing an organised directory structure in the left-hand corner. For multiple files, it is recommended to create a new folder and add your files in it.

### Step 4: I am all done with my work. How to create a Pull Request?

![Commit PR Image](/engineering-education/how-to-submit-your-first-article/commitPR.png)

- Go to your Github Desktop, you will see all the changes you have done in your branch. Write suitable details like what you've done in the "Summary" section (with an optional description). Then, click **"Commit"** in the bottom left-hand corner. Next, click **"Push Origin"** option to push your work into GitHub repository.


![Create PR Desktop Image](/engineering-education/how-to-submit-your-first-article/createPRdesktop.png)

- Once you're done with editing and updating your files, now you're all set to create a **Pull Request**. In order to do so, click **"Create Pull Request"**.

### Step 5: Verification & Final Submit
![Create PR Github Image](/engineering-education/how-to-submit-your-first-article/createPRfinalgithub.png)

- After clicking **"Create Pull Request"** button, you'll be automatically directed to GitHub repo. page where you can first verify all the details are correct or not. Finally, click **"Create Pull Request"** and Voila! you're done.

### Mission Completed!
