The term “chatbot” is on its way to becoming a household notion sooner than anyone has anticipated.
Although chatbots have been around for nearly three decades, their commitment has just recently started to accelerate in the media. The development of mobile devices with voice recognition apps added to this upsurge. Also, a more diluted name “digital assistant” helped people’s acumen. However, the user approval bar is still very high with chatbots, unlike many other applications. Are science and technology finally up to pass this bar?

### THE MOVIES EFFECT

Talking machines have been in the films since the first few episodes of Star Trek. An exceptional computer, knowing everything imaginable to know, guiding us on what to do, has been the fundamental theme of almost every science fiction movie. Finally, we nailed a point where it has become such a presumed functionality, that less than a comprehensive talking robot is absurd. Screenland effect is real and shapes customer expectations perhaps ahead of what is usually acceptable from a machine. We are very habitual of technology messing up in the middle of important work, but we will not stand less than a perfect chatbot.
####  We are long overdue for some real-life examples of talking computers that deliver reasonable conversations, thanks to movies.

### BIG PLAYERS ENTERING THE GAME
Do you remember Microsoft’s, Ms. Dewey? This chatbot with the nice graphical interface was released almost a decade ago and flunked quickly afterward. Perhaps she was too early for her time.
Chatbot technology has become a bold trial-and-error game, maybe because Apple could stomach Siri. We can add Amazon’s Echo to the list, and now Facebook’s API release. At least, Facebook is moving more guardedly by spreading the duty to independent developers. Google is also experimenting with chatbots without a convincing public demo.  
####  The entrance of the big players into the Chatbot game is a concrete development.

### ROBOTS AND SMART TOYS ARE ON THE RISE
There is an unstoppable ripple of robotic merchandise coming to the market. Led by Japan, and South Korea these robots can do incredible tricks. CHATBOTS ARE A NATURAL FIT TO ROBOTICS. Therefore, skilled chatbot technology can thrive in this market segment. You may find Connie, Hilton’s new robot concierge. IBM’s Watson showed us what to expect in the near future. You may run into vehicles that can talk to its driver. In-car voice recognition still has its way to go. However, a few automobile makers are taking this for creating in-car interfaces that are easy to use. Among the favorites are Infiniti, Mercedes, and Ford. It would make sense to keep your hands on the steering wheel, and eyes on the road while you talk to a chatbot for various purposes. But this is only the opening act. There is a huge realm of industrial machines. Operating each one of them needs expertise and knowledge, and chatting with them could improve safety and enhance efficiency. This list goes on and on.
####  Bottom line, every machine can talk to humans sometime in the future if it makes commercial sense.

### CHATBOTS CAN BE A NEW FORM OF SOCIAL DIGITAL PRESENCE
It all started with a Website concept in the 1990s. A person could have his/her own Website. Then, it was automated by MySpace. Then came the personal blogs. Social networks like Facebook and LinkedIn, followed by YouTube and Twitter, all impersonated a new form of digital presence of one’s self-image on the Internet.
Now, what if you had your own chatbot? Your chatbot could express who you are, your skills, perhaps the products you sell, services you offer.
####  Chatbots will become the ultimate form of self-expression and personal promotion.

### CHAT IS C-COMMERCE, A NEW CHANNEL FOR SALES
Sending messages has become a benchmark behaviour in the timeline of human evolution. Billions of messages are sent daily across the globe. Facebook Messenger, Google Chat, Skype, Instagram, WhatsApp, Slate, and many other platforms allow sending and receiving messages, none of which has been commercialized. 
Facebook’s Zuckerberg recently said “You never have to call 1-800 FLOWERS anymore” referring to Facebook’s Chatbot APIs mainly targeted for e-commerce and retail operations over the social network. Reasonably, we will recognize Facebook down the road as being the visionary company to open up this new channel.
####  Chatbots are the new sales channel and define C-commerce.

Out of the 5 reasons listed above, the C-commerce way of chatbots is perhaps the strongest argument for anticipating a gold rush. Sales dialogue is relatively easier for chatbots to handle, and there is money in the electronic commerce world floating back and forth.
####  The only stumbling block on the way is the accuracy of chatbot technology and ability to automate creation.
