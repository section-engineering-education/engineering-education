## Why is Node.Js wildly popular among developers?

Node.js has been a household name among developers for a few years now. So, what is this Node.js we've been all hearing around? Why is it so popular? Let's look at all this and more.

### What is Node.js?
The definition of Node.js is quite complex. It's not a programming language neither a framework nor a library. On their official [website](https://nodejs.org/en), Node.js is defined as a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js can be simply referred to as a technology. It is mainly used for backend operations and is/can be used together with frontend javascript frameworks like [Angular](https://angularjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and others. Node.js is similar in design to Ruby's [Event Machine](https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine) and Python's [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/).

### How and why did Node.js gain popularity?
Node.js was introduced into the developer's world in 2009 by the initial writer Rhan Dahl. Back in 2009, Apache HTTP server was a popular web server. But, it had a major problem, it could not handle a lot of concurrent connections. When Node.js was created it was able to solve the Apache problem. It offered scalability and parallel code execution. It introduced a new logic and approach for JavaScript server-side development. This has helped many developers.

 Since then its popularity has wildly grown. For instance in [Github](https://github.com/nodejs/node), Node.js has 71.9k stars, 17.6k forks, and 2.9k watchers. In [Stackshare](https://stackshare.io/nodejs) it has 54.4k followers and 8.2k votes. These numbers alone can show how popular Node.js is. Popular tech giants like Microsoft and Netflix use Node.js.

For the second year in a row, Node.js won the top spot in the StackOverflow's [2020 developer survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-other-frameworks-libraries-and-tools-all-respondents3). Over half of the respondents in the survey reported having used it in their projects.

 According to Node.js [metrics](https://nodejs.org/metrics/), Node.js has been downloaded more than 1 billion times globally.

## Why Node.js is popular among developers.

### 1. It is easy to learn Node.js.
 This is one of the major contributors to its wide usage.
 Among many developers, JavaScript skills are mandatory. Node.js uses Javascript. So, learning Node.js is relatively easy and few weeks of learning can get you up and running. Without JavaScript Knowledge, learning Node.js will take longer. So, learning Node.js is not that tricky. 
 
### 2. The scalability offered.
 Node.js is designed with scalable network applications in mind. Node.js can handle many concurrent requests. This is the main reason it quickly became popular among developers and large companies. With the ability to handle many simultaneous requests, the server does not strain. A callback is fired only after a request, but if there is no more jobs to be done, Node.js will sleep. Node.js is only online when needed. This avoids unnecessary usage of your RAM.
 
 ### 3. The Mobile-friendly, Cross-platform, and Dev-Friendly nature of Node.js.
 The ability to build flexible apps that run smoothly on any platform, be it Linux, Windows, or Mac Os gives Node.js a thumbs up. There has been a rise in cross-platform app development in the last few years. The fear of apps not running in other operating systems is gone, as Node.js took care of that. It has enabled developers to write apps that run on different platforms with little or no modifications being made.
 
### 4. Node.js is light and fast.
Node.js uses Google's V8 javascript engine which is built in C++. V8 engine handles memory allocation, compiles, and executes Javascript with lightning speed. More about Google's V8 JS engine can be found in the [docs](https://v8.dev/docs). Node.js uses a non-blocking model in performing operations. Node.js has published a full article on blocking and non-blocking models [here](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/blocking-vs-non-blocking/).  It handles requests made in a single asynchronous thread. This reduces CPU workloads as well as memory. This makes your app lightweight.

### 5.The many hosting providers available.
As a result of its growth in recent years, Many cloud-based hosting providers and web servers have added quite simple ways of hosting Node.js code. Some of these hosting providers include Heroku, Amazon Web Services, and DigitalOcean among others. There are also detailed and simple guides on the same.

### 6. Highly extensible
Node.js does not provide all that you need all at once. Instead, you customize or add what you need over time. This prevents having unnecessary libraries. [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - **Node package manager** is the default package manager in Node.js. Here, you can browse and install over 1 million open source packages. You can also use it to identify and install project dependencies.

### 7. Its caching ability
Node.js provides the ability to cache single modules. Caching is the storage of data for future requests. When a request is made, resources are fetched from the cache instead of the main servers. Thus, the web pages load faster and responds eagerly.

## What apps can I develop with Node.js?
So, you are asking, what kind of apps can I make with Node.js. The answer is: Node.js can be used to make almost all kinds of apps. Below are some of the apps you can develop using Node.js.

 - Single-page applications (SPA). eg. portfolio etc.
 - Social media applications. LinkedIn uses Node.js.
 - Real-time apps like chat apps.
 - Streaming apps. For example, Netflix.
 - Ecommerce apps. For example, Walmart.
 - Blogs.
 - Online Payment systems. For example, Paypal
 - APIs
 - Mobile apps. Node.js can be used together with other frameworks eg. ExpressJs to build mobile apps.
 - Many more.

## The advantages of using Node.js.

 - It is fast and scales on-demand.
 - Node.js modules and tools are easily available via [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
 - Node.js developers are easily available.
 - Strong community and bug tracking team.
 - It can be used to build a wide range of apps.
 - It's Cross-platform and mobile-friendly.
 - Hosting Node.js code is not a headache due to many supported hosting grounds.
 - It's lightweight and fast.
 - It's ability to handle many simultaneous requests.
 - Fast code execution.

## Conclusion

Looking at the rate at which Node.js has risen to be the most wanted technology since its release in 2009, you can simply tell that it's really powerful. By offering security, scalability and performance among other things, Node.js has become a solution to many problems. These are the main reasons behind its usage by large tech companies. Node.js offers many advantages compared to its competitors like ASP.NET. Since you now know what Node.js has to offer, why don't you give it a try in your next project?
