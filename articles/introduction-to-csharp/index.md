C# is an Object-Oriented Programming language and it is portable as it can develop software for many computer systems. C# was invented in 2002 and it is one of the programming languages widely used today.
<!--more-->
C# is pronounced as "C-Sharp".

Programs written in C# utilize the [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net45) to run. .NET is a framework used to make applications and run the .NET software. It was created by Microsoft and it runs primarily on the Windows operating system. There is an open-source implementation called [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/) which is cross-platform.

### Why C#?
C# is a unique language that is friendlier and easier to understand.

The performance of C# is exceptional in terms of speed and it uses very few resources. Many applications can be created using C#. 

Some of the applications that can be created with C# are:
- Web applications
- Networking applications
- Database applications
- Mobile application
- Videos games
- Service applications 

To get started, you will need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to write and compile code. We will be using [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) as our text editor.

### Installing C# 
After you have installed Visual Studio, choose .NET desktop development, and click *Modify*.

![vscode](/engineering-education/introduction-to-csharp/installation.png)

After the installation, click *Launch* to get started.  

On the new window, choose *Create a new project*.

![newproject](/engineering-education/introduction-to-csharp/vs1.png)

Once you have selected *Create a new project*, choose *"Install more tools and features"* then click *Next*.

![newproject](/engineering-education/introduction-to-csharp/Newproject2.png)

Choose *Console App (.NET Core)* from the list and click *Next*.

![newproject](/engineering-education/introduction-to-csharp/Consoleapp.png)

Enter your preferred project name and click *Create*. In this case, I will name my file *HelloWorld*.

![newproject](/engineering-education/introduction-to-csharp/projectname.png)

Visual Code will automatically generate some C# code for you.

![newproject](/engineering-education/introduction-to-csharp/Program.png)

Let's look at the code.

We have the code that will be generated below. It's a *Hello World* program.

```C#
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```

For you to run the program, press the *F5* key on your keyboard.
This will compile and run your code. 

A console window will open with the following output:

```bash
Hello World!

C:\Users\Username\source\repos\HelloWorld\HelloWorld\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.0\HelloWorld.exe (process 13784) exited with code 0.
To automatically close the console when debugging stops, enable Tools->Options->Debugging->Automatically close the console when debugging stops.
Press any key to close this window . . .
```

### C# Syntax
Let's look at each line of the code above that was generated by Visual Studio:

**Line 1:** 

```C#
using System;
```

In C#, it means that we can use the classes and methods available in `System`. It contains commonly-used types and classes. 
You can explore more in the [C# docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-directive).

**Line 2:**

```C#
namespace HelloWorld 
{
    // code declarations
}
``` 

Namespaces are used in C# to separate and organize code. They are containers consisting of methods, classes, and other namespaces.

**Line 3:**

``` C#
class Program 
{
    // code declarations
}
```

A class is a container that contains methods and data. Since C# is object-oriented programming, creating a class is mandatory for each program. In our case, we are creating a class called `Program`.

**Line 4:** 

```C#
static void Main(string[] args) 
{
    // code
}
```

Execution of a program begins from the `Main` method. Every C# program must have the `Main` method.

**Line 5:**

```C#
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```

`Console.WriteLine()` is used to print out text on the console. It prints a string and it adds a new line character to the end of the string. In our case, it's used to output *"Hello World!"*.

We can also use `Console.Write()` to print a string **but** it does not add a new line character to the end of the string. You can learn more on `Console.WriteLine()` and `Console.Write()` [here](https://www.programiz.com/csharp-programming/basic-input-output).

### Reading character(s) from the input
`Console.ReadLine()` is used to read the next **characters** in the input system.

`Console.Read()` is used to read the next **character** in the input system.

`Console.ReadKey()` is used to obtain the **next key** entered by the user. It's mostly used to hold the console for the user until he presses a key.

### Comments in C#
Comments start with two forward slashes. The compiler will ignore comments when compiling the code.

**Example**
```c#
// This is a C# program
```

This is a single-line comment. Comments are used by programmers to explain more about the line (what the line does). This concept is very important when a group of programmers are working together as it makes your code more readable to others.

For multiple-line comment, we use ` /*` and ends with `*/` :

**Example**
```C#
/* C# is a programming language used to create Web applications and Mobile applications.

It is an amazing language. */
```

Any text between `/*` and `*/` will be ignored by the compiler.

**Note:**

- Each line in C# ends with a semi-colon(;).

- C# follows a top to bottom order when executing the program.

- C# is case-sensitive as it treats Uppercase and Lowercase characters differently. e.g `program` and `Program` are different things.

**Congratulations!** You just wrote your first C# program.

Now, let's write a program that adds two numbers entered by the user.

```C#
//This is a C# program that adds two numbers

using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {       
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Enter your first number: ");
            int num1= Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
            Console.WriteLine("Enter your second number: ");
            int num2= Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
            int sum = num1 + num2; //adds the two numbers
            Console.WriteLine("Your Sum is " + sum); //prints the sum of the two numbers 
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
 }
```

Here's how the output of the program will look like:

```
Enter your first number: 2

Enter your second number: 5

Your Sum is 7
```

Let's look at the new lines in our program:

```c#
int num1= Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
```

It takes data from the user and allocates it to the memory location.

`int num1` means that we are creating a memory location to hold an integer (int) and naming that memory location for future reference. In our case, we have named the memory location as **num1** that will hold an integer.

When we prompt the user to enter any details using `Console.Readlint()`, C# takes the input as strings therefore, we have to convert the strings to numbers using the `Convert.ToInt32()` method above.

Using `=` (assignment operator), we are assigning the value given by the user to `num1`.

Just like integers, we have a data type called `double` which is used to store fractional numbers:

```C#
double num1;
```

If you'd like to learn more about the built-in types, refer to [this documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/built-in-types).
