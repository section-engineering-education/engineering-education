This article provides an overview of this exciting web design tool. It also provides a guide on how to get started with it. The article takes readers through the user interface of Figma and some basic tools used in web design.  

### What is Figma?
Figma is a web-based interface design tool that consists of powerful and exciting features for web design. This tool provides a collaborative and cost-effective platform for creating fascinating web designs.

It consists of unique design tools that provide an interesting experience to web developers. It can be used to perform various tasks such as vector illustration, user interface design, app design, and prototyping.

This application allows users to work on their projects online and offline through its desktop application. Files can be changed without the user being online. Figma has a sync feature that integrates the changes made in the desktop application with its web-based application. This feature works when the user goes online.

Figma works on various operating systems such as Linux, Windows, and Mac. The web-based application can work on various browsers such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Internet Explorer.

### Why web designers should choose Figma
#### Accessibility
This web design tool is easily accessible by web designers. It works well in browsers, which means that it is available on multiple platforms. Figma can also be accessed through its desktop app, that provides almost every feature that exists in its web-based application. This is a free tool for the first few projects (3 projects), which gives beginners room to learn how to use the design tool.

#### Easy project management
Figma files are stored in a cloud. This means that users can gain access to these files from any location. If users make changes to these files, they will be saved automatically. There is also an option to reverse the changes. Project management is made easier through this tool because all design projects can be kept in one place.

#### Collaboration
The design files saved in the cloud can easily be shared with other online users. You can also use the same files to collaborate with other designers (in real-time). This is an interesting feature because it allows members of the collaboration team to share files, ideas, and updates instantly.  

#### Features
Figma has all the necessary tools for developing a unique and quality web design. It consists of the following exciting design features.

- **Auto layout:** This enables users to develop responsive layouts. This feature also offers flexibility because of its ability to adjust automatically based on the user's content.
- **Robust vector networks:** These include modern pen and pencil tools that enhance drawing in all directions.
- **Instant arc designs:** Figma has an arc tool that can be used to design watch screens, clocks, or pie charts.
- **Plugins:** These are available for flow diagrams, charts, stock imagery, and color accessibility.
- **Flexible styles:** Figma has flexible and consistent styles such as grids, effects, text, and color. These can be applied to any object or text.
- **Accessible libraries:** It consists of libraries that can be accessed easily by all team members.
- **Export feature:** This format enables users to export their designs in various formats.

Figma also provides exciting prototyping features that enable designers to validate their designs. Some of these features include:
- **Shareable prototype:** It enables you to create and share a link of your prototype  design.
- **Dynamic overlays:** Users can create dynamic content overlays.
- **Animated GIFs:** Video elements, subtle animations, and motion designs can be represented using animated GIFs.
- **Instant design edits:** Figma provides an all-in-one platform that connects the design file with the prototype. Your prototype can generate design edits that appear instantly.

This section consists of presets for various elements such as phones, tablets, and social media. Let's assume that we want to design a smartphone app. We can choose to preview it on iPhone 11 max. Click on iPhone 11 max to get the related frame.

![iPhone 11 Frame](/engineering-education/using-figma-for-web-design/iphone-11-frame.png)

You can change the name of the frame by double-clicking on the box at the top left corner.

![Changing Frame Name](/engineering-education/using-figma-for-web-design/changing-frame-name.jpg)

The panel that appears on the right side of the interface can be used to change the orientation (landscape or portrait), size, and fit of the frame.

#### Working with shapes
If you want to create a shape, you should go to the shapes icon on the toolbar and select the desired shape.

![Creating Shapes](/engineering-education/using-figma-for-web-design/creating-shapes.jpg)

Let's assume we want to create a rectangle. In this case, we will click on the rectangle in the shapes tool. You should drag the cursor on the canvas to create the desired rectangle size. The rectangle will appear as follows.
