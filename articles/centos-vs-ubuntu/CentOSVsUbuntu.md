## CentOS Vs Ubuntu

Just like Windows and iOS, Linux is also an operating system. But unlike its competitors, its free and open source. Linus Torvalds developed it using a kernel, while he was attending the University of Helsinki in Finland.

When it comes to choosing a Linux distributive or "Distros," there are many options available in the market. It can be difficult for developers to choose among them. But the most tried and trusted ones are **CentOS** and **Ubuntu**. In this article, we will go through the differences between the two of the most trusted Linux distributions, CentOS, and Ubuntu.

### CentOS

CentOS is based on a Linux framework and a Linux distribution to implement a free, community-supported computing platform. It is compatible with the corresponding upstream source, Red Hat Linux. It is highly customizable, secure, and stable.

### Ubuntu

Ubuntu is an open-sourced and Linux distribution based on Debian. It is one of the popular operating systems for the Cloud. It is considered to be the best option for personal and professional use. It comes with more than 40,000 applications available. And is known to have the best security features.

## Architecture

### CentOS

CentOS architecture is based on Red Hat's source code to implement the core design similar to Red Hat Enterprise Linux. It is available free of charge.

### Ubuntu

Ubuntu packages are created in the Debian format. This package draws the basic architectural framework of Ubuntu, following continuous improvements in that framework.

## Support

### CentOS

There is an adequate amount of community support for CentOS and its end users. Yet, it is on a bit of a lower side than that of Ubuntu support.

### Ubuntu

The Ubuntu server has extensive community support for Cloud deployments, and also towards its end users. Thus, it is superior to CentOS from the support perspective.

## Learning

### CentOS

CentOs is based on Red Hat Linux. Ubuntu is a little bit harder to learn due to the presence of a smaller community and less available documentation.

### Ubuntu

Ubuntu has a wide range of online community support. It has an enormous amount of tutorials and books available in the market as well. Thus, it has the upper hand over CentOS from the learning perspective.

## Security

### CentOS

In the case of CentOS, it is based on the Linux framework. Thus, It is very secure and goes through three layers of security patches. It is also less prone to web security threats.

### Ubuntu

In the case of Ubuntu, the security patches also do perform well. But, sometimes, due to frequent updates, it is more prone to web threats. Sometimes it needs to downgrade to the lower version due to the presence of recent buddy updates.

## Ubuntu Vs CentOS - General Comparison

| Ubuntu | CentOS |

| --- | --- |

| Based on Debian | LBased on RHEL |

| Updated frequently | Updated scarcely |

| No cPanel support (has alternatives) | Supports cPanel/WHM |

| Larger user and developer community | Smaller user and developer community |

| Greater amount of help available in the form of tutorials and free guides. | Lesser amount of assistance available |

| Easier to learn for beginners that have used Ubuntu desktop in the past. | Harder to learn for beginners as there are few famous desktop distros released by RHEL |

| .deb packages installed using the apt-get package manager. | .rpm packages installed using the yum package manager |

## Final Word

The main difference between both of the Operating Systems is that one is based on Debian architecture while the other is based on RHEL. In terms of distribution, CentOS is more stable than Ubuntu. When it comes to the online community and tutorial, Ubuntu has the upper hand. 

When it comes to CentOS and Ubuntu comparison, both are well known and are two of the best Linux distributions. Each comes with its own set of pros and cons. Choosing one is an easy task if you consider your requirements. The whole goal of this article is to give a definite idea of both of these Operating Systems.
