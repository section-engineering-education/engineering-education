Biometrics are body measurements and calculations related to human characteristics. Biometrics is classified into two categories: Physical and behavioral. Physical biometrics is our humanly features such as our fingerprints, iris, and many others. Behavioral is our actions, for example, smiling, hand signs, and others.

In turn, biometrics has brought up vast, easy, and secure ways to identify a specific user using their physical traits.

### Introduction.
Biometrics are body measurements and calculations related to human characteristics. Biometrics is classified into two categories: Physical and Behavioral. 
Physical biometrics is our humanly features such as our fingerprints, iris, and many others. Behavioral is our actions, for example, smiling, hand signs, and others. In turn, biometrics has brought up vast, easy, and secure ways to identify a specific user using their physical traits.
Let us admit it, typing over eight characters in the name of a password is quite a task, that is, if a user even remembers the password. These days most developers and companies have made it easier for us by using biometrics as a form of authentication. Biometrics, time and again, has proved to be more efficient and less prone to cyber-attacks. This article will cover one of the biometric ways of authentication, which is using our fingerprint.

### Advantages of Biometrics.
- Biometrics is linked to a single individual (unlike a password, which a user can use without authorization),
- It is very convenient since there is no need to remember or carry anything.
- It is very secure. Biometrics is highly fraud-resistant.

### Disadvantages.
- They are error-prone, sometimes even causing the system to shut down; hence access is limited.
- Biometric devices and in-built biometric features are costly compared to other traditional devices.

### Goal
By the end of this tutorial, the reader should be able to:
- The reader should understand what biometrics is and the various applications of biometrics.
- The reader should understand how to implement fingerprint authentication in android applications.

### Prerequisites.
- The reader should be able to build basic Android applications.
- The reader should have basic knowledge of XML and Kotlin programming languages.
- The reader should have Android Studio installed.
- An Android mobile phone which has inbuilt biometric features, especially a fingerprint scanner.
