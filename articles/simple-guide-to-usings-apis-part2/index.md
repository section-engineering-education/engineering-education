# Getting to Grips with APIs: Authentication

Building on Part 1, we will use the Goodreads API to authenticate (oAuth 1) with a user's GoodReads account so they can return their own book data such as their shelves and books they've added.

Be able to use oAuth 1 authentication with the Goodreads API in order to make authenticated requests

Be able to use callback URLs so the user will be redirected back to their web app after signing in to GoodReads

Be able to store the current user's Goodreads ID so they can make authenticated requests on their behalf

Make authenticated Goodreads API requests for information such as a user's shelves or books
