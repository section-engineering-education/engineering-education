# What it Takesto be a DevOps Engineer
## Introduction
The software development life cycle involves many steps and a lot of time is taken to have the product. DevOps is a practice that aims to minimize the time taken for the software development life cycle to complete. DevOps is a collaboration between the development and the operations team, which enables continuous delivery of applications and services. Many organizations are now moving to DevOps [TechRepublic](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-become-a-devops-engineer-a-cheat-sheet/), thus making DevOps engineering jobs to be on-demand. DevOps is a field that is growing and that will continue to grow.
The development team creates the product, while the operations team manages and maintains this product. DevOps focuses on the continuous delivery of application when the development team is ready with the product it immediately goes into the maintenance and management phase. This article aims to help those interested in DevOps engineering careers. It gives a complete roadmap and sets a path of what it takes to be a successful DevOps engineer.

### Who is a DevOps Engineer?
A DevOps engineer is an IT person who understands the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and has depth understanding of various automation tools for developing digital pipelines ( Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, CI/CD pipelines) [edureka!](https://www.edureka.co/blog/devops-engineer-role)
DevOps needs to understand the whole purpose of the SDLC because it moved from the waterfall model to the agile model and finally to the DevOps lifecycle. They need to know the shortcomings of the previous models. Also, know how to use the automation tools for developing continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines.
A DevOps engineer understands all CI/CD pipelines phases from planning to the monitoring of the product. At the planning phase, an algorithm of the product being created is written. The second stage is building where the algorithm is transformed into code and to a product. The DevOps engineer tests the product to catch the bugs and errors. After testing, the product is sent to the deployment stage, and once deployed continuous monitoring of the product is necessary.
A DevOps engineer collaborates with the developers and the operations team to deliver high-quality products within a minimum amount of time. With the use of DevOps, there is good throughput, continuous system improvement, faster feedback, the product is released within a short time and there are fewer risks involved.

### Roles and Responsibilities of a DevOps Engineer
DevOps field is evolving very fast and to follow the career path here are the roles and responsibilities along with the description [upgrad]( https://www.upgrad.com/blog/devops-career-path-job-roles/).
1. DevOps Architect
The principal officer responsible for analyzing and executing the DevOps practices within the organization.
2. Integration Specialist
Responsible for integration and code continuity. An integration specialist supports engineering and testing the team to meet infrastructure needs and developed automation
3. Release Manager
He is responsible for releasing a product faster, releasing new product features, and ensuring stability. He effectively uses the CI/CD pipeline by planning, scheduling, Building, Testing, Deploying, monitor and controls the software development process.
4. Automation Engineer
He is responsible for achieving automation on applications and building using DevOps tools such as Git, Jenkins, Kubernetes, etc. The automation engineer uses configuration management tools such as Puppet, Ansible, Chef, etc to automate configuration across the infrastructure.
5. Quality Assurance
One responsible for testing the quality of the products, which have been developed and confirms to their requirements.
6. Software Tester
A test engineer is responsible for developing code and testing it. He verifies that changes made on code work well as intended and make sure the changes do not crush or break the final product.
7. Security Engineer
Security is very important for any product being developed, the DevOps emphasizes on continuous security. A security engineer is responsible for monitoring the products.

### DevOps Tools
- Git and GitHub
It is a source code management tool that enables code and files to be well organized and be easily accessible. Git manages huge projects, track changes, and allows multiple developers to work together.
- Jenkins
It is an open-source continuous integration tool, it helps to automate continuous development, testing, and deployment of newly created code. 
- Selenium
It is a testing tool, which provides fast execution, allows scripting in several programming languages, and supports parallel test execution.
- Docker
It helps with containerization. It enables high scalability and efficiency, reusable data volumes, and isolated applications.
- Ansible
It is a configuration management tool and uses SSH for secure connections
- Kubernetes
A container orchestration tool
- Puppet
A configuration management tool
- Chef
A configuration management tool
- Nagios
A monitoring tool. It has a comprehensive monitoring system, which enables continuous monitoring

### DevOps Engineer Skills
- Programming Language Knowledge
There are programming languages that go hand in hand with DevOps tools. The programming languages such as Python, Ruby, and Java Script develop and automates the software.
- Linux Fundamentals
A DevOps engineer should know the Linux Fundamentals such as Linux shell, Linux commands, and networking commands.
- Knowledge of DevOps tools, Configuration tools like â€“ Puppet, Ansible, Chef, etc. Source code management tools like Git and GitHub and monitoring tools such as Nagios.
- A DevOps engineer should know about cloud service providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google cloud. AWS is the most popular Cloud provider, it provides high scalability and flexibility, it is cost-effective and provides better security.
- A DevOps Engineer should have experience in developing continuous integration and continuous integration pipelines (CI/CD pipelines).
