In the ever-changing world of frontend and backend frameworks, learning and building RESTful APIs is a demanding skill for any software engineer. Adonis.js allows you to master the skills and knowledge to become a full-stack developer.

### Introduction
"A RESTful API uses HTTP requests to exchange data between parties using endpoints (routes). These [HTTP requests](https://towardsdatascience.com) include GET, PUT, POST and DELETE."

We will be showing you how to create a RESTful API with `Adonis.js 5`. We will be building an API for a forum. We will cover aspects such as authentication and authorization. The tutorial also covers best practices in structuring and building out your HTTPS endpoint and industry-standard responses.

Adonis.js is the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) of JavaScript and a good grasp of it is a high-demand skill. Therefore, learning to build your first REST API with Adonis.js is a game-changer. You can read through the [Ultimate Guide to Adonis.js 5](https://masteringbackend.com/posts/adonisjs-tutorial-the-ultimate-guide) to learn more.

### Outline
- Introduction
- Setting up Adonis.js
- Creating Databases
- Setting up Authorization and Authentication
- Creating Models
- Creating Controllers
- Creating Endpoint Routes
- Testing the Forum API
- Conclusion

### Setting up Adonis.js 5
If you’ve been working with JavaScript frameworks before, you should already have `Node.js` installed on your computer. If not, you can install the latest version by going through the steps [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

*Adonis.js needs Node.js >=12.x.x and NPM >=6.x.x, make sure you have the required Node.js by checking the version installed on your computer.*

We will assume you have the requirements, so you can go ahead to create a new Adonis.js 5 project by running this command.

```bash
    npm init adonis-ts-app adonisjs-forum-api
```

While you run the command, if you are asked to choose a project structure, select `API Server` and continue by leaving the other options default.

After installing successfully, open the folder with your favorite Text Editor and run the following commands in your terminal.

```bash
    cd <PROJECT_NAME>
    node ace serve --watch
```

Open your browser and visit the URL presented, if you see `hello world`.

Congratulations.

### Creating the database
Now that we have our first `Hello World` API created, our Forum API is incomplete without a database for storing, reading, and updating data.

Let’s set up our database right away:

You need to create a database with MySQL using any [Database Clients](https://masteringbackend.com/posts/top-10-database-clients-for-developers) of your choice.

To access and manipulate Databases seamlessly, let's install the LUCID ORM used by Adonis.js with this command.

```bash
    npm i @adonisjs/lucid@alpha
```

Then you need to configure it with the database you just created by running the `invoke` command and following the instructions.

```bash
    node ace invoke @adonisjs/lucid
```

When you run the above command, you will be presented with different database options. In this tutorial, we will go with MySQL/MariaDB and then select `In the Terminal` for the instructions.

Read through the instructions and update your `.env` file with your database credentials as follows.

```bash
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    MYSQL_USER= //DB_USER
    MYSQL_HOST=localhost
    MYSQL_DB_NAME= //DB_NAME
    MYSQL_PORT=3306
    MYSQL_PASSWORD= //DB_PASSWORD
```

If you want to change the databases' default configurations, you can always go to `config/database.ts` to configure some credentials.

If you encounter this error `Client does not support authentication protocol requested by server;` while testing your Forum API, follow these steps to solve it.

```bash
    npm install mysql2
```

Then open `config/database.ts` and update the `client` field to `mysql2`.

That’s all.

### Setting up Authorization and Authentication
In Adonis.js 5, authentication and authorization are very easy to set up. All you need to do is install the Auth package, and every other complicated authentication logic is built-in for you already.

Let’s get started:

Install the Auth package with this command.

```bash
    npm i @adonisjs/auth@alpha
```

As always, invoke the Auth package with the `invoke` command to configure it.

```bash
    node ace invoke @adonisjs/auth
```

It will ask you to select the provider, In this case, I picked `Lucid` and the `API Token` next since we are building an API.

1. Type in the `User` Model for your authentication,
2. Then press `Y` key to create a migration for it.
3. Next, choose `Database` as your provider.
4. Now press `Y` again to create a migration for the `api_tokens`.

Now, you should have two migrations in your `database/migrations` folder. Update the `xxxxx_users.ts` file to include a `name` and any other columns of your choice.

Now add the `auth` middleware to the `kernel.ts` file inside `start/kernel.ts`:

```ts
Server.middleware.registerNamed({
  auth: "App/Middleware/Auth",
});
```

### Creating migrations
We should create the remaining migrations for the Post and Forum models that will be used later.

Let’s get started. 

Create a new migration using this command:

```bash
    node ace make:migration posts
```

After running the command, open the new file in `database/migrations/xxxx_posts.ts` and paste the code below.

```ts
import BaseSchema from "@ioc:Adonis/Lucid/Schema";
export default class Posts extends BaseSchema {
  protected tableName = "posts";
  public async up() {
    this.schema.createTable(this.tableName, (table) => {
      table.increments("id");
      table.string("title", 255).notNullable();
      table.string("content", 255).notNullable();
      table.integer("user_id", 180).notNullable();
      table.integer("forum_id").nullable();
      table.timestamps(true);
    });
  }
  public async down() {
    this.schema.dropTable(this.tableName);
  }
}
```

For now, we are keeping it simple by creating our database schema for `posts` that will contain the following columns listed in the code without defining any database constraints.

Next, we will create the `Forum` schema and paste in the following codes too.

    `node ace make:migration forums`

And the following codes.

```ts
import BaseSchema from "@ioc:Adonis/Lucid/Schema";
export default class Forums extends BaseSchema {
  protected tableName = "forums";
  public async up() {
    this.schema.createTable(this.tableName, (table) => {
      table.increments("id");
      table.string("title", 255).notNullable();
      table.string("description", 255).notNullable();
      table.integer("user_id", 180).notNullable();
      table.timestamps(true);
    });
  }
  public async down() {
    this.schema.dropTable(this.tableName);
  }
}
```

We will also keep this one simple by creating our database schema for `posts`, containing the following columns listed in the code without defining any database constraints.

The `public async up` and `public async down` are also two important methods of the `BaseSchema` object. While the `up` method is responsible for running migrations and creating database schemas, the `down` method is also used to drop the created schema/table.

Next, we will run the migrations to generate and create the database tables as specified in the migrations.

To run our migration, we need to stop the server and start it again:

```bash
    node ace serve --watch
    // Then
    node ace migration:run
```

You can set up database seeders to generate fake data or [clone my repository](https://github.com/Kaperskyguru/adonisjs-forum-api) since we have configured that already.

Cheers!

### Creating models
Now, we will create all the models we need for this API and configure them properly to interact with our database.

```bash
    node ace make:model Forum
    node ace make:model Post
```

You can [clone my repository](https://github.com/Kaperskyguru/adonisjs-forum-api) to see how we map the columns and configure the relationships.

This is a preview of how the model looks like for a `User` model:

```js
import { DateTime } from "luxon";
import Post from "App/Models/Post";
import Forum from "App/Models/Forum";
import Hash from "@ioc:Adonis/Core/Hash";
import {
  column,
  beforeSave,
  BaseModel,
  hasMany,
  HasMany,
} from "@ioc:Adonis/Lucid/Orm";
export default class User extends BaseModel {
  @column({ isPrimary: true })
  public id: number;
  @column()
  public email: string;
  @column()
  public name: string;
  @column({ serializeAs: null })
  public password: string;
  @column()
  public rememberMeToken?: string;
  @column.dateTime({ autoCreate: true })
  public createdAt: DateTime;
  @column.dateTime({ autoCreate: true, autoUpdate: true })
  public updatedAt: DateTime;
  @hasMany(() => Post)
  public posts: HasMany<typeof Post>;
  @hasMany(() => Forum)
  public forums: HasMany<typeof Forum>;
  @beforeSave()
  public static async hashPassword(user: User) {
    if (user.$dirty.password) {
      user.password = await Hash.make(user.password);
    }
  }
}
```

The above code creates the `Post` or `Forum` models, respectively, with the different columns mapped using the `columns` decorator. It also specifies the datatypes for each column.

Many other decorators such as `hasMany` for a `one-to-many database relationship` are defined on the model.

### Creating controllers
In this step, we are going to create `controllers` for the above `Models`. Before that, let’s create an AuthController for the authentication.

```bash
    node ace make:controller Auth
```

Open the file in `app/Controllers/Http/AuthController.ts` and paste the code below.

```js
import { HttpContextContract } from "@ioc:Adonis/Core/HttpContext";
import User from "App/Models/User";

export default class AuthController {
  public async login({ request, auth }: HttpContextContract) {
    const email = request.input("email");
    const password = request.input("password");
    const token = await auth.use("api").attempt(email, password, {
      expiresIn: "10 days",
    });
    return token.toJSON();
  }
  public async register({ request, auth }: HttpContextContract) {
    const email = request.input("email");
    const password = request.input("password");
    const name = request.input("name");
    const newUser = new User();
    newUser.email = email;
    newUser.password = password;
    newUser.name = name;
    await newUser.save();
    const token = await auth.use("api").login(newUser, {
      expiresIn: "10 days",
    });
    return token.toJSON();
  }
}
```

The code above simply registers and logins a user without any complex validations and error handling. So, it is easy to understand.

Next, let’s create all the `controllers` for our `API` at once:

```bash
    node ace make:controller Post
    node ace make:controller Forum
```

Open the `PostsController.ts` file, which is inside the `app/Controllers/Http` folder, and add the code below.

```ts
    import { HttpContextContract } from "@ioc:Adonis/Core/HttpContext";
    import Post from "App/Models/Post";
    export default class PostsController {
         public async index({ request}: HttpContextContract)
        {
            const posts = await Post.query().preload('user').preload('forum');
            return posts
        }
        public async show({ request, params}: HttpContextContract)
        {
            try {
                const post = await Post.find(params.id);
                if(post){
                    await post.preload('user')
                    await post.preload('forum');
                    return post
                }
            } catch (error) {
                console.log(error)
            }

        }

        public async update({ auth, request, params}: HttpContextContract)
        {
            const post = await Post.find(params.id);
            if (post) {
                post.title = request.input('title');
                post.content = request.input('content');
                if (await post.save()) {
                    await post.preload('user')
                    await post.preload('forum')
                    return post
                }
                return; // 422
            }
            return; // 401
        }

        public async store({ auth request, response}: HttpContextContract)
        {
            const user = await auth.authenticate();
            const post = new Post();
            post.title = request.input('title');
            post.content = request.input('content');
            post.forumId = request.input('forum');
            await user.related('posts').save(post)
            return post
        }
        public async destroy({response, auth, request, params}: HttpContextContract)
        {
           const user = await auth.authenticate();
           const post = await Post.query().where('user_id', user.id).where('id', params.id).delete();
           return response.redirect('/dashboard');
        }
    }
```

The code above represents the CRUD functionalities for our API for the `Post` model. It contains different methods for the business logic of our app, such as deleting `(destroy)`, updating `(update)`, storing `(store)`, and retrieving `(index)` Posts in the database.

You can [clone the repository](https://github.com/Kaperskyguru/adonisjs-forum-api) to review the other controllers that I have created.

### Creating endpoint routes
The next step is to create the endpoints for our frontend or mobile App to consume.

To do that, open the `route.ts` file inside the `start` folder and add the following code.

```ts
//......
Route.group(() => {
  Route.post("register", "AuthController.register");
  Route.post("login", "AuthController.login");
  Route.group(() => {
    Route.resource("posts", "PostsController").apiOnly();
    Route.resource("forums", "ForumsController").apiOnly();
    Route.get("users/forums", "UsersController.forumsByUser");
    Route.get("users/posts", "UsersController.postsByUser");
  }).middleware("auth:api");
}).prefix("api");

//......
```

The above code creates our `Routes` for different `endpoints` that can access our forum app. The `Route.group` puts a list of routes into a single group with a single prefix. The `middleware` adds a script that will be executed before the request passes to the controller.

So far, we have created different endpoints for our Forum API.

>Note that the `resource` method creates all the CRUD endpoints we need for our Forum API. You can learn more about it [here](https://preview.adonisjs.com/guides/http/routing#crud-actions).

### Testing the forum API
When testing your endpoint using any HTTP clients, such as [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io), you might face the error `Cannot find module 'phc-argon2'`. 

To resolve it, please run this command to install the package.

```bash
    npm install phc-argon2
```

If we test the `posts` endpoint without authentication, we will face this error.

![Test API Error](/engineering-education/build-a-restful-api-with-adonisjs/test-api-error.png)

The error is eliminated if we login using the `/api/login` or register via the `/api/register` endpoint to retrieve our API Token.

![Test API Auth](/engineering-education/build-a-restful-api-with-adonisjs/test-api-auth.png)

We can access the protected endpoints after inserting the token as the `Authorization header` value.

### Conclusion
In this article, we covered how to build a RESTful API in Adonis.js 5. We created a simple Forum API with authentication and authorization.

You can clone the [repository here](https://github.com/Kaperskyguru/adonisjs-forum-api).

You can now use these skills to create more productive and appealing applications.

Happy coding!
