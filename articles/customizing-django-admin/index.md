### Customizing Django Admin
Django is a Web framework for perfectionists with deadlines. That is why it comes with its admin site. Django gives programmers the power of customizing this admin site to suit the requirements of the project or the needs of the client.

### Prerequisites
Before we begin, you should have the following:
 - Python3 installed on your machine.
 - Django installed on a virtual environment on your machine.
 - Some knowledge of Python 3 and Django.

### Step 1 â€“ Creating our Django app
Open the command line and execute the following command to create the project.
```bash 
$ django-admin startproject Custom
```
Now let's change to the created directory `Custom`.
```bash
$ cd Custom
```
In `Custom`, let's go ahead and create our app called "Bookstore".
```bash
$ django-admin startapp Bookstore
```
Then, add Bookstore to the installed apps in `settings.py`.
```python
INSTALLED_APPS  = [
  # ...
  'Bookstore' # new
]
```
Next, use the following command to create a virtual environment in the project folder level.
```bash
$ py -m venv .venv
```
Then, activate it using the following command.

```bash
$ .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Now we can install Django in the virtual environment.

```bash
$ pip install django
```
###  Creating the Models
Add the following code to your *models.py* to create some models.

```python
from django.db.models.deletion import CASCADE

class  Category(models.Model):
  cat_romance  =  "Romance"
  cat_fantacy  =  "Fantacy"
  cat_thriller=  "Thriller"
  cat_horror  =  "Horror"
  cat_crime  =  "Crime"
  cat_true_story=  "True Story"
  category  =  models.CharField(
      max_length=100,
      choices=(
      (cat_crime, cat_crime),
      (cat_fantacy, cat_fantacy),
      (cat_horror, cat_horror),
      (cat_romance, cat_romance),
      (cat_thriller, cat_thriller),
      (cat_true_story, cat_true_story)
        )
        )

  def  __str__(self):
      return  self.category

class  Publisher(models.Model):
  publisher_name  =  models.CharField(max_length=100)
  publish_date  =  models.DateField

  def  __str__(self):
      return  self.publisher_name

class  Author(models.Model):
  gender_male  =  "Male"
  gender_female  =  "Female"
  gender_other  =  "Other"
  name  =  models.CharField(max_length=100)
  gender  =  models.CharField(max_length=100,
      choices=(
      (gender_female, gender_female),
      (gender_male, gender_male),
      (gender_other, gender_other)
      )
      )
  country  =  models.CharField(max_length=100)

  def  __str__(self):
      return  self.name

class  Details(models.Model):
  book_name  =  models.CharField(max_length=100)
  category = models.ForeignKey(Category, on_delete=CASCADE)
  pages = models.IntegerField(default=1)
  publisher  =  models.ForeignKey(Publisher, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
  Author  =  models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=CASCADE)

  def  __str__(self):
      return  self.book_name
```
We can now go ahead and register our models in *admin.py* by adding the following lines of code.
```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.db import models
from .models import Category, Publisher ,Details, Author

class  categoryAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
  pass

class  publisherAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
  pass

class  detailsAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
  pass

class  authorAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
  pass

admin.site.register(Category, categoryAdmin)
admin.site.register(Publisher, publisherAdmin)
admin.site.register(Details, detailsAdmin)
admin.site.register(Author, authorAdmin)  
```
Then make the migrations and migrate using the below commands.

```bash
$ py manage.py makemigrations
$ py manage.py migrate
```
Now, let us create a superuser in order to start customizing our admin site.
```bash
$ py manage.py createsuperuser
```
Now run the development server using the command below:
```bash
$ py manage.py runserver
```
You can now log in using the superuser credentials at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/. You should see something similar to this.
###  1 -  Setting plural text for models
We can change how the models *category* and *details* are appearing in plural at the admin site by adding the below code to `models.py`.
```python
class  Category(models.Model):
# ...
  class  Meta:  #new
      verbose_name_plural  =  "Categories"     

class  Details(models.Model):
# ...
  class  Meta:   #new
      verbose_name_plural  =  "Details"
```
###  2. Changing the Django administration header text
To change the admin site header text, the login page and the HTML title tag so that we can put the name of our bookstore instead, add the following code in `urls.py`.
```python
#...
admin.site.site_header  =  "Custom bookstore admin"  
admin.site.site_title  =  "Custom bookstore admin site"
admin.site.index_title  =  "Custom Bookstore Admin"
```
*site_header* changes the *Django administration* text which appears on the login page. The *site_title* appears on the admin page after we have logged in. The *index_title* changes our site's title that appears on the top of the page.

###  3. Removing the default apps
Let's say we want to get rid of the *Groups* app that is found in our Django admin site by default. We will go ahead and unregister it in `admin.py` after importing it.

```python
from  django.contrib.auth.models  import  Group  # new
#...
admin.site.unregister(Group)  # new
```
If you like, you could also go ahead and unregister *users* through the same process.

###  4 - Using list_display
You might also want your *details* model to display more than one column at the change list page. To add other fields we will have to make some adjustments in `admin.py`.
```python
class  detailsAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
  list_display=('book_name','category','Author','pages','publisher')
#pass
```
### 5. Adding an image in Django admin
We might also want to add the image of the Author besides their name using list display. To do that we will first have to install a third-party app called `pillow`. Using a terminal, run the following command.
```bash
$ pip install pillow
```
Then we open `settings.py` and add the following code. This code tells Django where to store the images.

```python
import os # at the top
#...
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR , 'media')
```
Now let's create the media folder and add an images folder inside it.
```bash
$ mkdir media\images 
```
The next thing is going to our `urls.py` and adding the code below to add our `media` folder to the static files.
```python
# below the other imports
from . import settings
from django.contrib.staticfiles.urls import static
from django.contrib.staticfiles.urls import staticfiles_urlpatterns

#...

urlpatterns +=staticfiles_urlpatterns()
urlpatterns +=static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```
In `models.py`  we are going to import `mark_safe` and add the image field to our *Author* model. Then we will add a function that will enable us to view the image in our admin site.

```python
# at the top
from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe
# in our Author model
class  Author(models.Model):

author_pic = models.ImageField(upload_to='images/', null=True)

def  image_tag(self):
    return mark_safe('<img src="/../../media/%s" width="150" height="150" />' % (self.author_pic))

image_tag.allow_tags = True 
```
Now let us makemigrations then migrate to reflect the changes in our database.
```bash
$ py manage.py makemigrations
$ py manage.py migrate
```
The only thing left is to call our function inside the list display. Lets go to our `admin.py` and modify `authorAdmin()`.
```python
class  authorAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display=['name','image_tag']
```
Now, run the development server and enjoy the view.

###  Conclusion
With the information in this tutorial, you can customize your Django admin.

Happy coding!
