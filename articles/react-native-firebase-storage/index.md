In this tutorial, we will be building a Non-Expo React Native application to upload images and videos to Firebase cloud storage. Firebase is a platform developed by Google used to create mobile and web applications. It was originally an independent company founded in 2011.
<!--more-->
### Firebase
In 2014, Google acquired the platform and it is now their flagship offering for app development. Cloud Storage for Firebase is a powerful and cost-effective storage service. The Cloud Storage SDK supports file uploads and downloads for your apps. You can use the cloud storage SDK to store images, audio, video, or other user-generated content.

### Prerequisites
The fundamentals of React and React Native will not be covered in this tutorial. If you are not comfortable with the fundamentals, this is a [helpful tutorial](https://reactnative.dev/docs/tutorial) that you can go through before beginning with this project.

### Overview
We'll be going through these steps in this article:

1. Development environment.
2. Setting up the Firebase project.
3. Setting up Firebase storage.
4. Installing dependencies.
5. Building the UI.
6. Adding media picker.
7. Uploading media.
8. Adding upload progress.
9. Adding pause/resume upload.
10. Get the download URL.
11. Recap.

You can take a look at the final code in this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/zolomohan/react-native-firebase-storage-non-expo).

### Development environment
> **IMPORTANT** - We will not be using Expo in our project.

You can follow [this documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to set up the environment and create a new React app.

Make sure you're following the React Native CLI Quickstart, not the Expo CLI Quickstart.

![Env Setup](/engineering-education/react-native-firebase-storage/env_setup.png)

### Installing dependencies
You can install these in advance or while going through the article.

```JSON
"@react-native-firebase/app": "^10.4.0",
"@react-native-firebase/storage": "^10.4.0",
"react": "16.13.1",
"react-native": "0.63.4",
"react-native-image-picker": "^3.1.3",
```

To install a dependency, run:

```bash
npm i --save <package-name>
```

After installing the packages, for iOS, go into your `ios/` directory, and run:

```bash
pod install
```

> **IMPORTANT FOR ANDROID**
>
> As you add more native dependencies to your project, it may bump you over the 64k method limit on the Android build system. Once you reach this limit, you will start to see the following error while attempting to build your Android application.
>
> `Execution failed for task ':app:mergeDexDebug'.`
>
> Use [this documentation](https://rnfirebase.io/enabling-multidex) to enable multidexing.
> To learn more about multidex, view the official [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/multidex#mdex-gradle).

### Setting up the Firebase project
Head to the [Firebase console](console.firebase.google.com/u/0/) and sign in to your account.

Create a new project.

![Create New Project](/engineering-education/react-native-firebase-storage/firebase_new.png)

Once you create a new project, you'll see the dashboard.

![New Dashboard](/engineering-education/react-native-firebase-storage/new_dashboard.png)

Now, click on the Android icon to add an Android app to the Firebase project.

![register_app](/engineering-education/react-native-firebase-storage/register_app.png)

You will need the package name of the application to register the application. You can find the package name in the `AndroidManifest.xml` that is located in `android/app/src/main/`.

![Package Name](/engineering-education/react-native-firebase-storage/package_name.png)

Once you enter the package name and proceed to the next step, you can download the `google-services.json` file. You should place this file in the `android/app` directory.

This file contains configurations that'll enable your application to access firebase services.

![Download Google Services JSON](/engineering-education/react-native-firebase-storage/download_services.json.png)

After adding the file, proceed to the next step. It will ask you to add some configurations to the `build.gradle` files.

First, add the `google-services` plugin as a dependency inside of your `android/build.gradle` file:

```bash
buildscript {
  dependencies {
    // ... other dependencies

    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.3'
  }
}
```

Then, execute the plugin by adding the following to your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```bash
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

You need to perform some additional steps to configure `Firebase` for `iOS`. Follow [this documentation](https://rnfirebase.io/#3-ios-setup) to set it up.

Finally, we should install the `@react-native-firebase/app` package in our app to complete the set up for Firebase.

```bash
npm install @react-native-firebase/app
```

### Setting up Firebase storage
Head over to the Storage section in the dashboard and click on the `Get Started` button.

![Get Started Storage](/engineering-education/react-native-firebase-storage/enable_storage.png)

A modal will pop up with information about the storage rules. By default, only authenticated users can read and write from the cloud storage. Since we are not going to cover authentication in this tutorial, we will change the rules and set the cloud storage to open.

> Do not set your cloud storage as open in a production application. This will allow anyone to read and write to your cloud storage, compromising all the data in your cloud storage.

![Default Rules](/engineering-education/react-native-firebase-storage/default_rules.png)

On the next step, it will ask you for the storage bucket location.

![Bucket Location](/engineering-education/react-native-firebase-storage/bucket_location.png)

Once this is done, you'll see this screen. You can upload files and delete files manually from this screen.

![Storage Setup Done](/engineering-education/react-native-firebase-storage/storage_setup_done.png)

Now, let's edit the cloud storage rules and set the cloud storage bucket as `open`. Switch to the `Rules` tab.

![Storage Rules Tab](/engineering-education/react-native-firebase-storage/storage_default_rules.png)

Now, replace the existing rules with this.

```bash
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

If you'd like to learn more about cloud storage rules, refer [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/security).

### Building the UI
In the `App.js`, let's add 4 buttons to the screen.

- Take a Photo.

- Record Video.

- Pick a Photo.

- Pick a Video.

```JSX
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.screen}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Firebase Storage</Text>
      <View>
        <TouchableOpacity style={styles.button}>
          <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Take Photo</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
        <TouchableOpacity style={styles.button}>
          <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Record Video</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
        <TouchableOpacity style={styles.button}>
          <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Pick a Photo</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
        <TouchableOpacity style={styles.button}>
          <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Pick a Video</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
}
```

Styles:

```JSX
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  screen: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 35,
    marginVertical: 40,
  },
  button: {
    backgroundColor: '#47477b',
    color: '#fff',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    paddingVertical: 15,
    paddingHorizontal: 40,
    borderRadius: 50,
    marginTop: 20,
  },
  buttonText: {
    color: '#fff',
  },
});
```

![App UI](/engineering-education/react-native-firebase-storage/app_ui.jpg)

### Adding media picker
Now, the first 2 buttons should open the camera to take a photo and record a video respectively, and the next 2 buttons should open the gallery to pick an image and video respectively.

Let's install the `react-native-image-picker` to add these functionalities.

```bash
npm install react-native-image-picker
```

> The minimum target SDK for the React Native Image Picker is `21`. If your project targets an SDK below 21, bump up the minSDK target in `android/build.gradle`.

After the package is installed, import the `launchCamera` and `launchImageLibrary` functions from the package.

```JSX
import { launchCamera, launchImageLibrary } from 'react-native-image-picker';
```

Both functions accept 2 arguments. The first argument is `options` for the camera or the gallery, and the second argument is a callback function. This callback function is called when the user picks a media or cancels the operation.

Check out the [API Reference](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-image-picker#api-reference) for more details about these functions.

Now let's add 4 functions, one for each button.

```JSX
const onTakePhoto = () => launchCamera({ mediaType: 'image' }, onMediaSelect);

const onTakeVideo = () => launchCamera({ mediaType: 'video' }, onMediaSelect);

const onSelectImagePress = () =>
  launchImageLibrary({ mediaType: 'image' }, onMediaSelect);

const onSelectVideoPress = () =>
  launchImageLibrary({ mediaType: 'video' }, onMediaSelect);
```

Let's create a function called `onMediaSelect`. This is the callback function that we passed to the `launchCamera` and the `launchImageLibrary` functions. We will get the details of the media that the user picked in this callback function. We'll use that to upload the media to the cloud storage.

We should start the upload process only when the user did not cancel the media picker. If the user cancelled the operation, the picker will send a `didCancel` property in the response object.

```JSX
const onMediaSelect = async (media) => {
  if (!media.didCancel) {
    // Upload Process
  }
};
```

You can learn more about the response object that we get from the `launchCamera` and the `launchImageLibrary` functions [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-image-picker#the-response-object).

Now, pass the 4 functions to the `onPress` prop of the `TouchableOpacity` for the respective buttons.

For example:

```JSX
<TouchableOpacity style={styles.button} onPress={onTakePhoto}>
  <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Take Photo</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

### Uploading media
Let's install the package for Firebase storage.

```bash
npm install @react-native-firebase/storage
```

Once the package is installed, let's import the package.

```JSX
import storage from '@react-native-firebase/storage';
```

To upload a file to the cloud storage, we should create a reference object.

A reference is a pointer to a file in your bucket. This file can either exist already, or it may not exist yet.

We need to use the `ref` method to create a reference.

```JSX
const reference = storage().ref('<filename>');
```

You can also specify a file located in a nested directory:

```JSX
const reference = storage().ref('/directory1/directory2/filename.png');
```

Now, we should use the `putFile` method in the `reference` object to upload the image from the user's device to the cloud storage. The `putFile` method accepts a path to the file on the user's device.

The callback function that we passed to `launchCamera` and the `launchImageLibrary` functions will get the `URI` of the image in the response object. We need to pass the `URI` to the `putFile` method.

```JSX
const onMediaSelect = async (media) => {
  if (!media.didCancel) {
    const reference = storage().ref(media.fileName);
    const task = reference.putFile(media.uri);
  }
};
```

Once the media has been uploaded, you can take a look at it in the Firebase console.

![uploaded media](/engineering-education/react-native-firebase-storage/uploaded_media.png)

We don't have any visual feedback while the media is uploading. Let's add that in the next step.

### Adding upload progress
The state of the `Task` object that is returned from the `putFile` method will keep changing while the file is getting uploaded. We can add an event handler to handle this state change.

```JSX
task.on('state_changed', (taskSnapshot) => {
  // Handle Event Here
});
```

The callback function that we pass will receive a [`TaskSnapshot`](https://rnfirebase.io/reference/storage/tasksnapshot) object. It'll contain the number of bytes transferred and the total number of bytes of the file.

We can use this information to display the upload progress.

Let's create 2 states in the application: One to maintain whether the file is getting uploaded and the other for the `TaskSnapshot` object.

```JSX
const [uploading, setUploading] = useState(false);
const [uploadTaskSnapshot, setUploadTaskSnapshot] = useState({});
```

Let's set the `uploading` state to `true` when the `onMediaSelect` is called.

```JSX
const onMediaSelect = async (media) => {
  if (!media.didCancel) {
    setUploading(true);
    const reference = storage().ref(media.fileName);
```

Now, we need to set the `TaskSnapshot` object on the `state_changed` event handler.

```JSX
task.on('state_changed', (taskSnapshot) => {
  setUploadTaskSnapshot(taskSnapshot);
});
```

Let's display the progress in the UI using these states along with an activity indicator and a status text. This should be displayed only when a file is being uploaded.

```JSX
import { ActivityIndicator } from 'react-native';
```

```JSX
{uploading && (
  <View style={styles.uploading}>
    <ActivityIndicator size={60} color="#47477b"></ActivityIndicator>
    <Text style={styles.statusText}>Uploading</Text>
    <Text style={styles.statusText}>
      {`${((uploadTaskSnapshot.bytesTransferred / uploadTaskSnapshot.totalBytes) * 100).toFixed(2)}% / 100%`}
    </Text>
  </View>
)}
```

Styles:

```JSX
center: {
  flex: 1,
  width: '100%',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  alignItems: 'center',
  paddingHorizontal: 50,
},
uploading: {
  marginTop: 80,
  justifyContent: 'center',
  alignItems: 'center',
},
statusText: {
  marginTop: 20,
  fontSize: 20,
},
```

![Upload Progress](/engineering-education/react-native-firebase-storage/upload_progress.gif)

### Adding pause/resume upload
Let's add a state to maintain whether the upload is paused or not. This will be a boolean state.

```JSX
const [paused, setPaused] = useState(false);
```

Let's add a button to Pause/Resume the upload when a file is being uploaded.

```JSX
{uploading && (
  <View style={styles.uploading}>
    <ActivityIndicator size={60} color="#47477b"></ActivityIndicator>
    <Text style={styles.statusText}>Uploading</Text>
    <Text style={styles.statusText}>
      {`${((uploadTaskSnapshot.bytesTransferred / uploadTaskSnapshot.totalBytes) * 100).toFixed(2)}% / 100%`}
    </Text>
    <TouchableOpacity style={styles.button}>
      <Text style={styles.buttonText}>{paused ? 'Resume' : 'Pause'}</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>
  </View>
)}
```

![Pause](/engineering-education/react-native-firebase-storage/pause.gif)

To pause/resume the upload, we need to use the `Task` object. It has 2 methods: `pause` and `resume`. Since the task object is inside the `onMediaSelect` function, let's set up a state outside and assign the `Task` object to that state when it's created.

```JSX
const [uploadTask, setUploadTask] = useState();

const onMediaSelect = async (media) => {
  if (!media.didCancel) {
    setUploading(true);
    const reference = storage().ref(media.fileName);
    const task = reference.putFile(media.uri);
    setUploadTask(task);
```

Now, we can write a function to toggle between pause and resume.

```JSX
const togglePause = () => {
  if (paused) uploadTask.resume();
  else uploadTask.pause();
  setPaused((paused) => !paused);
};
```

Pass this function to the `onPress` pass of the pause button.

```JSX
<TouchableOpacity style={styles.button} onPress={togglePause}>
  <Text style={styles.buttonText}>{paused ? 'Resume' : 'Pause'}</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

Let's update the status text to *paused* and hide the activity indicator if the upload is paused.

```JSX
{!paused && <ActivityIndicator size={60} color="#47477b"></ActivityIndicator>}
<Text style={styles.statusText}>
  {paused ? 'Paused' : 'Uploading'}
</Text>
```

![Resume](/engineering-education/react-native-firebase-storage/resume.jpg)

### Get the download URL
The `putFile` method returns a [Task](https://rnfirebase.io/reference/storage/task) object.

We can add a `.then()` to it that will get called when the upload is completed. If not, the `.catch()` will be called.

```JSX
const onMediaSelect = async (media) => {
  const reference = storage().ref(media.fileName);
  const task = reference.putFile(media.uri);
  task.then(async () => {
    // Get Download URL Here
  });
};
```

We can get the download URL using the reference to the storage location.

```JSX
task.then(async () => {
  const downloadURL = await reference.getDownloadURL();
});
```

Let's create a button that will open the link in your phone's browser.

To do so, let's create a state to store the download URL and access it outside this function.

```JSX
const [downloadURL, setDownloadURL] = useState();
```

Let's set the URL once we get it.

```JSX
task.then(async () => {
  const downloadURL = reference.getDownloadURL();
  setDownloadURL(downloadURL);
});
```

Now, let's create a button in the UI. This button will only be displayed when a download URL is available.

```JSX
{downloadURL && (
  <TouchableOpacity
    style={[styles.button, style.mediaButton]}>
    <Text style={styles.buttonText}>View Media</Text>
  </TouchableOpacity>
)}
```

Styles:

```JSX
mediaButton: {
  position: 'absolute',
  bottom: 0,
  marginBottom: 50,
  width: 300,
},
```

We need to use the `Linking` module from `react-native` to open the link in the phone's browser. Let's import it.

```JSX
import { Linking } from 'react-native';
```

To open the link, we should use the `openURL` method in the `Linking` module.

```JSX
<TouchableOpacity
  style={[styles.button, styles.mediaButton]}
  onPress={() => Linking.openURL(downloadURL)}>
  <Text style={styles.buttonText}>View Media</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

Now, the button should open the media that we uploaded on the phone's browser.

![View Media](/engineering-education/react-native-firebase-storage/view_media.jpg)

### Let's Recap

1. We set up our development environment and created a React Native app.

2. We created a Firebase project.

3. We set up cloud storage for our Firebase project.

4. We updated the cloud storage rules to be open for everyone. Keep in mind that you should never keep it open in a production environment.

5. We built a simple UI for the app.

6. We added the `react-native-image-picker` package to pick images/videos using the gallery and capture images/video using the camera.

7. We installed the Firebase cloud storage package.

8. We created a cloud storage reference using the `ref` function.

9. We uploaded our file to the location which was being pointed by the reference we created.

10. We added an event handler for the `state_changed` event during upload and used the `TaskSnapshot` object to get the upload progress.

11. We added a button to pause/resume the upload.

12. We got the download URL from the reference and added a button to open it in the phone's browser.

Congratulations, :partying_face: You did it.

Thanks for Reading!
