Laravel is a simple-to-understand PHP-based system. It makes it easy to code complex features in an application. Email authentication is one characteristic that can be implemented easily using Laravel.
<!--more-->
Usually, if a user signs up on the website, we need to check emails. This process ensures that we only accept those users with valid email addresses. In the past, it was quite difficult to code or include email verification in web applications. 

Laravel's arrival made life for developers easier. In other words, implementing email verification in Laravel only requires a few lines of code.

### Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, you will need the following:     
- PHP
- Laravel 8.x
- MySQL

### Goal
To implement email verification on a website using Laravel.

### Step 1: Laravel 8 installation
You can create a new Laravel application either via Composer or Laravel installer.  

#### Installing via composer
Laravel uses `Composer` for the control of dependencies. Therefore, make sure you have Composer installed on your computer before installing Laravel. 

You can download composer from [here](https://getcomposer.org/download/). After the installation is complete, check its version using the following command. 
 
```bash
composer --version
```

Build a new directory somewhere on your machine for your new project, 'verifyEmailApp'. Then navigate to the folder and install Laravel using the following instruction.  
```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel verifyEmailApp
cd verifyEmailApp
php artisan serve
```

`php artisan serve` command allows the application to be hosted locally.

#### Using Laravel installer  
Laravel has a 'Laravel installer' command-line utility which is used to install Laravel applications. To download the Laravel installer, we use the following command:   

```bash
composer global require laravel/installer
```

You need to make sure that the 'Composer binary folder' is inside your '$PATH' variable in order to run the Laravel installer.  
Check if it is in your `$PATH` variable by running the following command in your terminal:  

```bash
echo $PATH
```

The correct output should look, as shown below:  
`User/username/.vendor/composer/bin`  

Modify your '.bashrc' in case of any errors (no output on the screen) or, if you use 'ZSH', your '.zshrc' to provide the path to your composer's vendor directory.

This command creates a new installation for Laravel in your chosen directory when installed. To build a project without having a subdirectory in the current working directory, it is possible to use a . (a dot) instead of '[foldername]'.  

```bash
laravel new verifyEmailApp
cd verifyEmailApp
php artisan serve
```

>You can learn more about Laravel installation from [here](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/installation).  

### Step 2: Configuring database
The `config/database.php` file contains all the database configurations. You should, therefore, define all the database details in this file. Remember, all database configurations should be private.   

Modify the following properties according to your database settings in the `.env` file.

```bash
DB_CONNECTION=mysql #you can change this to any database
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=verification #database name
DB_USERNAME=MyDatabaseUserName #insert username
DB_PASSWORD=MyDatabasePassword #insert password
```

You will notice that Laravel 8 automatically updates this file without running the command:  

```bash
php artisan config:clear
```

> NOTE: While using Laravel 7.x, you have to clear the `cache` to reflect changes made.  

### Step 3: Simple mail transfer protocol configurations
In this article, we will set up [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/). We will use this service to test and send emails. Mailtrap simulates the actual SMTP server and delivers your emails to a test recipient.  

Laravel supports many email services that are out-of-the-box. SMTP, Mailgun, Postmark, Amazon SES, and Sendmail are included here. At 'config/mail.php', we can set up the default email service and its credentials.

Let's get the Mailtrap credentials before editing the `mail.php` file. Switch to and sign up for an account with [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/). We are going to use an account with a free plan in this tutorial. The free plan enables us to send 500 emails a month and offers one inbox. 

It's only appropriate for small applications. If you have signed up, open the Demo inbox and your account will have SMTP credentials. Pick Laravel from the drop-down menu under the SMTP Settings tab. This shows the configuration you want to use in the Laravel framework.  

The best way to configure Mailtrap is to copy its configuration to the `.env` file of the program. This enables your application to deliver emails to the Mailtrap inbox. However, you may replace Mailtrap with Mailgrid, SES, or Mailgun after deploying the Laravel app. 

Here are the required Mailtrap configurations.

```bash
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=YOUR_USERNAME
MAIL_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=YOUREMAIL
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

>This tutorial strongly recommends you use [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/) due to its simplicity and well-structured documentation.  

### Step 4: Installing Laravel Jetstream Scaffolding  
Laravel 8 distanced itself from its scaffolding for authentication and supports Jetstream Scaffolding instead. Jetstream is described as a "beautifully designed application starter kit for Laravel that provides the ideal starting point for your next Laravel application."  

Jetstream provides login, registration, 'email verification', two-factor authentication, session management, API via Laravel Sanctum, as well as optional features for team management. 

You can learn more about the new Laravel features including authentication scaffolding from [here](/engineering-education/laravel-8-new-features/).

This tutorial assumes you already have a Laravel project set up and running. If you do not have a project configuration for Laravel, you can do so before proceeding further.  

Using Composer, the Jetstream installation process will begin. 

In your terminal, execute the following instruction.  
```bash
 composer install laravel/jetstream
``` 

We need to wait for the installation to complete then compile the project's assets using the command below: 

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

Finally, you can run database migration with `php artisan migrate`.  

One key error that you might face is 'Max key length is 1000 bytes'. This means you need to change your service provider's default string length. 

Navigate to `app > providers > appserviceprovider.php` and copy and paste the following code into the boot method: 

```bash
Schema::defaultStringLength(191);
```    

Also, since new tables have been added, you will need to re-migrate. Enter `php artisan migrate: fresh` command in your terminal. This modification helps eliminate the `max string` error. 

### Step 5: Model preparation
Laravel application ships with a `User` model (the data structure in a database). By default, this model class does not implement the `Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\MustVerifyEmail` contract.

Therefore, our first step is to activate the `MustVerifyEmail` interface.  

```php

<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\MustVerifyEmail;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements MustVerifyEmail
{
    use Notifiable;
 /**
     * The attributes that are mass assignable.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $fillable = [
        'name', 'email', 'password','email_verified_at'
    ];
  
    /**
     * The attributes that should be hidden for arrays.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $hidden = [
        'password', 'remember_token',
    ];
}
```

Adding this interface allows you to send verification emails to newly registered users. Laravel also comes with a `SendEmailVerificationNotification` listener. 

It is located at the `App\Providers\EventServiceProvider` and attached to `Illuminate\Auth\Events\Registered`. This event allows you to send a verification link to the user.  

### Step 6: Routing
Three routes are required to implement email verification in Laravel:    
- A route to display the email verification notification to the user with a link to verify email.
- A route to handle the user-click event to verify email.  
- A route to resend email on user's request.  

### Step 7: Email verification notification
After sending a message to the user, we should return a view asking them to check their inbox to complete the verification process.   

```php
Route::get('/email/verify', function () {
    return view('auth.verify-email');
})->middleware('auth')->name('verification.notice');

```

>Note: The name of the route returning the email verification notice MUST be named `verification.notice`

### Step 8: Handling email verification
Now that you've sent an email with a verification link, what happens next?

When clicked, this link should redirect users to either the dashboard or any other specified route. Let's take a look at how we would handle this user-click event.  

```php

use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\EmailVerificationRequest;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

Route::get('/email/verify/{id}/{hash}', function (EmailVerificationRequest $request) {
    $request->fulfill();

    return redirect('/home');
})->middleware(['auth', 'signed'])->name('verification.verify');

```

>Note: This route must be named `verification.verify`

### Step 9: Resending email verification link
Some users may experience challenges during this authentication phase. For example, some sites use a Time Password with an expiration date. If a user delays activating their account, the OTP will expire. In this case, a new `One Time Password` should be regenerated.  

This slightly relates to how the Laravel email verification link works. A user may delete the email accidentally before verification. To solve this problem, Laravel provides a feature to resend verification emails on user's requests.  

```php

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

Route::post('/email/verification-notification', function (Request $request) {
    $request->user()->sendEmailVerificationNotification();

    return back()->with('message', 'Verification link sent!');
})->middleware(['auth', 'throttle:6,1'])->name('verification.send');

```

### Step 10: Protecting application routes
Within your application, there are routes that unverified users should not visit. The most appropriate way to protect these routes is by adding `middleware`, as shown below.  

```php
Route::get('/profile', function () {
    // This route can only be accessed by confirmed users...
})->middleware('verified');
```

Unverified users are automatically redirected to the email verification notice route.

### Conclusion
In this tutorial we have learned how to incorporate email authentication using Laravel. We also addressed how our routes should be secured, thus stopping unauthorized users from accessing them. Therefore, you can use this experience to create more innovative applications.  

Happy coding.
