This article will go through basics of C++ constructors. A constructor is a special member function that initializes the objects of its class. It is said to be special because its name is the same as the class name. 
<!--more-->
### Introduction
Constructors are invoked every time it creates an instance of the class. They automate destroying allocated variables therefore the programmer doesnâ€™t have to create a function call to destroy them.

#### Prerequisites
To follow through this article, you will need:
  - A basic understanding of C++ language.
  - A basic understanding of C++ functions.
  - [Codeblocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads) IDE to run the code.

### What we will go through
  1. [Syntax of constructor functions](#syntax-of-constructor-functions)
  2. [Characteristics of constructor functions](#characteristics-of-constructor-functions)
  3. [Types of Constructors](#types-of-constructors)

### Syntax of constructor functions
```c++
class integer
{
  int a , b;
public:
  integer(void); // constructor declaration
};

integer:: integer(void) // constructor definition
{
  a=2;
  b=2;
}
```

When we create a constructor, it ensures the initialization of the object we created in our program. The declaration `integer v1;`  initializes our object `v1` and assigns the data members `a` and `b` the value  `2`. 

With normal member functions, we have to write a statement to initialize each of the objects. If we had a large number of objects, it would result in a lot of code that might be messy and difficult to read.

### Characteristics of constructor functions
- Constructors are invoked automatically when we create objects.
- Constructors should be declared in the public section of the Class.
- Constructors cannot return values to the calling program because they do not have return types.
- Constructors should always be non-virtual. They are static functions and in C++ so they cannot be virtual.     
- Constructors cannot be inherited because they are called when objects of the class are created. It is therefore not realistic to create a base class object using the derived class constructor function.
- We cannot refer to the addresses of constructors since we only require the address of a function to call it and they can never be called directly. Also, the language does not permit it.

***NOTE: Whenever a Constructor is declared, initialization of the class objects becomes imperative.***

### Types of constructors

#### 1. Default constructors
These are constructors that do not pass or accept any parameters. The default constructor for a class C is `C::C()`. The compiler supplies a default constructor for instances where it is not defined.

Therefore a statement such as `integer v1` invokes the default constructor of the compiler to create the object v1.

**Example of default constructor**
```c++
// c++ program to illustrate the concept of constructors

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class integer
{
public:
  int x, y;

// Default Constructor declared
  integer()
  {
    x = 45;
    y = 10;
  }
};

int main()
{
  // Default constructor called automatically when the object is created
  integer a;
  cout << "x: " << a.x << endl << "y: " << a.y;
  return 0;
}
```

In the program above, the compiler will automatically provide a default constructor implicitly. 

Our program output will be:
```bash
x: 45
y: 10
```

#### 2. Parameterized constructors
In practice, we may be required to initialize the data elements of different objects with different values. C++ enables us to accomplish this by the use of parameterized constructors that can take parameters when the objects are created

In the program below we are going to illustrate how our constructor `integer()` will be used.

```c++
// C++ program to illustrate parameterized constructors

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class integer
{
private:
  int a, b;
public:
  // Parameterized Constructor
  integer(int x, int y)
  {
    a = x;
    b = y;
  };

  int getX()
  {
    return a;
  };

  int getY()
  {
    return b;
  };
};
int main()
{
  integer v(10, 15); // Constructor called

  cout << "a = " << v.getX() << endl; // values assigned by constructor accessed
  cout<< "b = " << v.getY() << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

The output is:
a = 10
b = 15

Initial values have to be passed to the object through parameterized constructors and the normal declaration of a statement will not work. We can pass the initial values as arguments by either calling the constructor implicitly or explicitly.

For example our declaration above, can be declared implicitly as:

```c++
integer v(10,15);  // implicit call
```

This statement passes the values 10 and 15 to our integer object `v`. 

We can also pass our values explicitly as follows:
```c++
integer v=integer(10,15); // Explicit call
```

However, the first method is preferred to the second because it's shorter and easier to apply.

***NOTE: The arguments of a constructor function cannot be the type of the class to which it belongs to.***

For instance:

 ```c++
class v {
public:
  v(v);
};     //is illegal.
 ```

#### 3. Copy constructors
When we discussed parameterized constructors, we mentioned that the parameters of a constructor function cannot be the type of the class to which it belongs. 

However, constructors can accept a reference to its class as a parameter. Copy constructors initialize an object using another object that is of the same class.

In C++, copy constructors are called using the cases below:
1. Whenever objects of the class are returned by value.
2. Whenever objects are constructed based on another object that is of the same class.
3. Whenever objects are passed as parameters.

We are required to define our copy constructor functions particularly if an object has runtime allocation of resources or pointers.

**Example of a copy constructor**
```c++
// C++ program to illustrate copy constructor

class integer
{
	int a ,b;
public:
	integer (integer &v) // copy constructor declared
  {
    a=v.a;
    b=v.b;
  };
};
```

#### 4. Multiple constructors
C++ allows us to use the three constructor functions we have discussed in the same class.

For example:
```c++
class complex
{
  int a, b;
public:
  complex() // default constructor
  {
    a= 10;
    b=45;
  };
  complex( int x, int y) // parameterized constructor
  {
    a=x;
    b=y;
  };
  complex( complex & v)	// copy constructor
  {
    a=v.a;
    b=v.b;
  };
};
```

- The first constructor function has no values passed by the calling program therefore the constructor assigns itself the data values.
- The second constructor function has parameters in which the function call passes the appropriate values from the main function.
- The third constructor function receives objects as arguments. Copy constructors set the values of the first data element to the value of the corresponding.

**Constructor overloading**

This is where more than one constructor function is defined in a class. Overloaded constructors have the same name as the class but with a different number of arguments. 

They are based on the number and type of parameters passed to the calling function. The compiler will know which constructor requires to be called depending on the arguments passed when the object is created.

```c++
// C++ program to illustrate Constructor overloading

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class shape
{
  int a, b;
public:
  // Constructor with no argument
  shape()
  {
    a= 2;
    b= 3;
  };
  // constructor with one argument
  shape(int x)
  {
    a=b=x;
  };
  // Constructor with two arguments
  shape(int x, int y)
  {
    a= x;
    b= y;
  };
  int area(void)
  {
    return(a*b);
  };
  void display()
  {
    cout<<"area="<< area() <<endl;
  };
};
int main()
{
  // Constructor Overloading with two different constructors of class name
  shape s;
  shape s2(6);
  shape s3( 3, 2);

  s.display();
  s.display();
  s.display();
  return 0;
}
```
The output is:
area=6
area=6
area=6

### Conclusion
In this article, we have gone through the basics of constructors and how to overload them. In C++ programming, the primary goal of the constructor is to create an object of the class. In other words, it's used to initialize all members of the data class. This enables programmers to limit instantiation and write code that's flexible and easy to read.
