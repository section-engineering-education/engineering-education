Verifying website domains for originality can be complicated during a time where the internet is constantly being used for both good and bad. By using Python Shell and Windows PowerShell within a Windows environment, determining the credibility of a website domain name we determine website domain originality.
<!--more-->
This topic could interest individuals and/or groups who would like to verify domain names for their validity and credibility through coding.

At the end of this tutorial, you will understand how to retrieve DNS (Domain Name System) information using the Python Shell,  run `curl` in the Windows PowerShell to crawl websites, and how to identify the complexities of domain modifications in an ever-changing technology space.

Overall, this tutorial will help complete reverse domain name lookups.

### Prerequisites
*Software and Hardware*
- Windows Operating System (Version 10).
- Python Shell (Any version that is compatible with the packages and functions mentioned. *3.8.5 will be used here*)
- Windows PowerShell
- Internet connection
- Internet browser

*Knowledge*
- Python Programming language
- Package/Library installations
- Working with 'PATH' or directories
- Run PowerShell as Administrator
- Command Prompts and its structures
- Website mechanics (terms include but not limited to: layers, domains, and hosting)
- Webpage scripting (HTML or JavaScript)

### Let's get started with Python Shell
Some Python compatible packages that will be used are `socket`, `dns`, and `whois`. Let's make sure that the packages are installed and functional using the command prompt window and the designated 'PATH' or 'ROOT' from folder-to-folder are accurate will be slightly more time efficient.

In `socket`, the opportunity to find the IP (Internet Protocol) address associated with the domain name can be processed.

The following lines of codes are processed in socket.

Input:
```python
import socket
domainName = 'interviews-massiveinsights.digital'
ip = socket.gethostbyname(domainName)
print ("IP:", ip)
```

Output:
```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
socket.gaierror: [Errno 11002] getaddrinfo failed
>>> print ("IP:", ip)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'ip' is not defined
```

*Screenshot*:

Because the domain name was removed due to unoriginality, error messages were displayed.

Shown below is a functional and valid output of the code since the domain is active and has not been removed.

Input:

```python
import socket
domainName = 'massiveinsights.com'
ip = socket.gethostbyname(domainName)
print ("IP:", ip)
```

Output:

```python
IP: 69.195.108.249
```

*Screenshot*:

![socket-valid](/engineering-education/verifying-website-domains/socket2.jpg)

In `DNS`, a plentiful array of resource information is displayed given that the website domain is still active.

This is a good opportunity to use for-loops held within a variable to iterate and display all results.

Input:

```python
import dns
import dns.resolver
ip = "69.195.108.249"
myResolver = dns.resolver.Resolver()
req = '.'.join(reversed(ip.split("."))) + ".in-addr.arpa"
myAnswers = myResolver.resolve(req, "PTR")
ans = [item for item in myAnswers]
ans
```

Output:

```python
[<DNS IN PTR rdata: 69-195-108-249.unifiedlayer.com.>]
```

*Screenshot*:

![dns-ptr](/engineering-education/verifying-website-domains/dns-ptr.jpg)

The PTR (Pointer Record) value determines if the domain can resolve.

Some hosting websites may hold several domain names within its capacity regardless of intentions which may not resolve the domain. Another reason could be that the data has not been added to DNS records.

Below, there are further options within the `DNS` function revealing additional information about the domain such as nameservers and DNS parking which are a few critical elements in establishing website internet connection.

Instead of using the IP address, use the domain name in the myAnswers variable and replace "PTR" with "NS", "TXT", and/or "MX".

"NS" for nameserver information Input:

```python
myResolver = dns.resolver.Resolver()
myAnswers = myResolver.resolve('massiveinsights.com', "NS")
ans = [item for item in myAnswers]
ans
```

Output:

```python
[<DNS IN NS rdata: ns3.bdm.microsoftonline.com.>, <DNS IN NS rdata: ns4.bdm.microsoftonline.com.>, <DNS IN NS rdata: ns1.bdm.microsoftonline.com.>, <DNS IN NS rdata: ns2.bdm.microsoftonline.com.>]
```

"TXT" for additional internet properties Input:

```python
myResolver = dns.resolver.Resolver()
myAnswers = myResolver.resolve('massiveinsights.com', "TXT")
ans = [item for item in myAnswers]
ans
```

Output:

```python
[<DNS IN TXT rdata: "google-site-verification=34Jb2Tx28xLGRll4nwbUOq6dyu-P_VOD3OcO9qqDTKo">, <DNS IN TXT rdata: "mscid=w87OZ8XPKbefuE8BURYoqwPFO1CdSFjEo5RIqw7JWEL/fy7vVSsP/Q6Slgu5MYk2ihGpG6SHuF70r+a7X9J8cw==">, <DNS IN TXT rdata: "v=spf1 ip4:72.139.55.134 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all">]
```

"MX" for digital mailing information Input:

```python
myResolver = dns.resolver.Resolver()
myAnswers = myResolver.resolve('massiveinsights.com', "MX")
ans = [item for item in myAnswers]
ans
```

Output:

```python
[<DNS IN MX rdata: 0 massiveinsights-com.mail.protection.outlook.com.>]
```

`Whois`, is a continuous recording registry for websites, it is one of several databases that compiles and lists website information.

Input:

```python
import whois
whois_info = whois.whois("interviews-massiveinsights.works")
print("Domain registrar:", whois_info.registrar)
print("WHOIS server:", whois_info.whois_server)
print("Domain creation date:", whois_info.creation_date)
print("Expiration date:", whois_info.expiration_date)
```
Output:

```python
Domain registrar: None
WHOIS server: None
Domain creation date: None
Expiration date: None
```

*Screenshot*:

![whois-invalid](/engineering-education/verifying-website-domains/whois-invalid.jpg)

Null values would be an indication that modifications were made during the development of the website.

Most original websites will openly disclose this information as exemplified below.

Input:

```python
import whois
whois_info = whois.whois("massiveinsights.com")
print("Domain registrar:", whois_info.registrar)
print("WHOIS server:", whois_info.whois_server)
print("Domain creation date:", whois_info.creation_date)
print("Expiration date:", whois_info.expiration_date)
```
Output:

```python
Domain registrar: GoDaddy.com, LLC
WHOIS server: whois.godaddy.com
Domain creation date: 2012-06-04 23:22:58
Expiration date: 2021-06-04 23:22:58
```

### Next up, Windows PowerShell
*Make sure to right-click and select the `Run as Administrator` option before running PowerShell.*

Windows PowerShell is structured differently. There are subcategorized features to select specific content in a website language. It is essential to select and include `.Content` at the end of the command.

As shown below, brackets are used to call a website with an API to sift through permissible website layers and must begin with `curl`.

Input:

```PowerShell
(curl host.io/careers-massiveinsights.works).Content
```

Partial Output:

```PowerShell
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html  style="scroll-behavior: smooth;">

<head>
    <title>careers-massiveinsights.works (Default page) - host.io</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="google" value="notranslate">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no, user-scalable=no">
    <meta name="description" content="careers-massiveinsights.works (hosted on hostinger.com) details, including IP, backlinks, redirect information, and reverse IP shared hosting data">
```

*Screenshot*:

Scroll down to the `text-primary` class layer to display all associated domains with the IP address.

Partial Output:

```PowerShell

When confronted with a domain that may appear authentic and genuine, it might be best to do some coding research first.

Domains and websites in general have components that identify themselves when initiating internet presence.

**Here are a few website components:**
- DNS records
- Extension purchases are readily available in a wide variety of selections.
- Website hosting providers and its ability to offer e-mail addresses for any purpose with the website domain.

These components can be combined and modified to replicate an already existing website domain or create a completely unique website domain.

#### Special consistency factors to look for:
- Date-time stamp values
- Null or missing values
- Web hosting provider
- Extension creation date and purchase
- IP address
- Associated domains with IP address

**Time to match values up**
If possible, compare values with the original to find any matches. If not, output values can offer insights.

*What does a match mean?*

Most likely related to the original website domain.

*What does a mismatch mean?*

Most likely a replicated version of the original. Beware, be cautious, and watch out.

Try the tutorial out next time a suspicious website domain crosses your path while using the internet. The results can be fascinating.

It can possibly protect individuals and/or groups from the dark web.

Happy coding!
