In this tutorial, we will perform 3D object detection using the mediapipe library. We will be drawing a 3D bounding box around an object instead of the popular 2D bounding boxes that we are used to.

### Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you need to:
- Be familiar with machine learning modelling.
- Be familiar with the python programming language.
- Install either Jupyter notebook or Google colab.
> To follow along with this tutorial, please use Google colab.
