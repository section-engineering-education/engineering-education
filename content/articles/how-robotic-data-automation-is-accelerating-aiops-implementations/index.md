Robotic Data Automation (RDA) is a key enabler of artificial intelligence for IT operations (AIOps). It functions similarly to robotic processing automation by automating the DataOps. Robotic Data Automation (RDA) is a platform that leverages the advantages of artificial intelligence and automation to create intelligent IT workflows using low-code databots.

Automation facilitates data integration when handling machine data for analytics. RDA is a framework and toolkit with the capabilities for implementing data automation. RDA is a key enabler of artificial intelligence for IT operations (AIOps). 

It functions similarly to robotic processing automation by automating the DataOps. It simplifies and accelerates the implementation of AIOps and reduces the time and costs associated with data integrations and preparations.

In addition to giving an in-depth review of what RDA is, this article compares RDA to RPA and explains how Robotic Data Automation Fabric and edge analytics work together.

### The value of RDA
RDA simplifies and automates repetitive data integration tasks. [Artificial intelligence](/engineering-education/artificial-intelligence-future/) has become significant in digital transformation. According to the International Data Corporation, global AI expenditure was about [USD 500 billion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/08/03/how-robotic-data-automation-could-automate-data-pipelines/?sh=29c2746b4e58) in 2014. 
Robotic Process Automation and other technologies are behind this growth. 

The demand for [hyperautomation](/engineering-education/accelerating-automation-with-hyper-automation/) is also on the rise. However, organizations are accelerating the implementation of digital transformation strategies faster than they can manage. As a result, the presence of massive unused real-time data for analytics and insights is very prevalent.

Most organizations' predictive models are built to rely primarily on historical data, and thus they may become ineffective in dealing with real-time data. Robotic Data Automation comes as a solution to these challenges. RDA utilizes historical and real-time data to transform, cleanse, and contextualize data. Essentially, RDA complements the ETL and ELT systems to guarantee easier data access and sharing across distributed environments.

To demonstrate how RDA creates values, we need to assess its functions in a log management system. RDA augments the intelligent layer in the log management system to increase efficiency without disrupting any running processes. Some of the benefits that come with implementing an RDA-led log management system include:

- Automating alerts: RDA analyzes raw log data and utilizes it to create automated alerts to avoid missing any new or modified log entries.
- Providing contextual insights: RDA provides contextual log data automatically, reducing the user's search time.
- Removing duplicates: RDA identifies and leaves out duplicated alerts to increase the quality of the alert system.
- Summarizing alert log pattern: RDA summarizes the alert log patterns to reduce the costs and time of retaining historical knowledge.
- Providing alternative or additional data sources: where data is complex or non-existent, RDA provides other data sources to the log management system.
- Anomaly detection: RDA collects data and compares it to the historical CPU usage data for a specific node to identify the likelihood of any anomalies.
- Change detection: RDA examines virtual machines and compares them to the current states to determine any changes.
- Ticket clustering: It compiles tickets in a firm's [ticket management system](https://www.itbusinessedge.com/data-center/finding-value-in-robotic-data-automation/), clusters them together, and sends the output to a dashboard for visualization.

### Robotic process automation (RPA) vs. robotic data automation (RDA)
While both RDA and RPA are critical automation systems and show many similarities, they also differ in various ways. Robotic data automation is a data-driven platform that utilizes software bots and low-code pipelines to automate IT workflows. It enables organizations to automate data integration, preparation, and transformational tasks. The primary goal of RDA is to enhance automation using no-code data workflows. This makes the implementation of AIOps viable by eliminating manual data integrations.

[Robotic Process Automation](/engineering-education/what-is-robotic-process-automation/) also presents the concept of automation. But its automation does not focus on AIOps but rather on reducing the manual handling of otherwise repetitive processes. After installation on a server, virtual machine, or cloud, RPA can control how an entire company's applications run. It mimics human actions on computer systems to enhance productivity. RPA runs on an organization's servers without any human intervention. It acts as virtual workers that operate on a pre-defined schedule. This automation system handles aggregation, sorting, distributing big data, and segregation activities.

### Robotic data automation fabric (RDAF) and data observability
Digital businesses now focus on achieving service assurance to maintain a competitive edge in the market. But the increasing complexity of multi-cloud services, cloud-native applications, and the rise of [edge computing](https://www.section.io/blog/tag/edge/) frustrate their goal of service assurance. So, to overcome this challenge, they require full-stack observability. At the same time, the clients need an approach that tames the data while facilitating actionable insights.

Robotic Data Automation Fabric (RDAF) is critical in implementing this observability. In this case, observability will help an organization determine the internal state of a system using its externally available outputs. Making observability a reality requires a combination of DataOps and AIOPs, which RDAF makes possible. RDAF infuses artificial intelligence for IT operations with robotic data workflow automation. It does this by using technologies, such as natural language generation, integrated development environment, and natural language processing. This combination facilitates the building of instantaneous pipelines with low-code databots that accelerate AI delivery. Ultimately, robotic data automation fabric makes observability a reality, solving the service assurance issue that many organizations were experiencing.

### RDAF and edge analytics
Robotic data automation fabric is a platform that unifies observability, artificial intelligence for IT operations, and automation domains. It can govern data located at the edge of a network, the cloud, or on-premises. RDAF currently runs in the hybrid [cfxCloud](https://www.cloudfabrix.com/platform/) as an observability pipeline. CfxCloud integrates with cfxEdge through a messaging interface to interlink with the edge. The cfxEdge is responsible for the association of RDAF and edge analytics. It runs on a third-party data source and provides the mechanism for collecting and transforming using artificial intelligence/machine learning selected data in the cfxCloud.

RDAF uses low-code databots to create instantaneous pipelines. Each databot is like a stacked atomic unit that accesses its own messaging application programming interface (API) and data store. The databot is programmable using an integrated development environment. This databot is responsible for the implementation of DataOps and AIOps. Databots are containerized, and as such, they can operate at the edge and help form an automated data fabric that loops in RDAF. Combining RDAF and edge analytics is critical in providing pipeline tracing and overall data governance.

### Conclusion
Robotic data automation is a new technology that helps organizations solve AIOps challenges. It simplifies and accelerates AIOps implementations while automating data integration processes. RDA's intervention ensures cost-effective data analysis. Its replacement of manual interventions with automated services makes organizations operate more efficiently.

RDA also automates IT workflows and facilitates anomaly detection and change detection in computer systems. It has a close association with Robotic Process Automation. RDA concentrates on how data moves through the low-code pipelines during integration and distribution, while RPA focuses more on enhancing automation at the operations processes level of the process. Essentially, RDA is data-driven while RPA is process-driven.
