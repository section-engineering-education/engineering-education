### Prerequisites
To follow through this article, you need to have a basic understanding of `session board controllers`

### Introduction to Udoo X86 II Ultra
Udoo X86 II Ultra session board controller's power is comparable to that of a new typical personal computer in the market today. Udoo X86 II Ultra comes embedded on the same platform with an Arduino Leonardo 101 board made with a more powerful X86 maker architecture.

Udoo X86 II Ultra can run most of the applications that could be run on a PC.

These applications include:
- Professional development platforms
- Graphical editors
- 3D gaming software
- Video streaming
- Libraries
- Sketches
- The official Arduino Leonardo IDE
- Applications present in the Arduino Leonardo space

Udoo X86 II Ultra is a genuine computer. The absence of drivers or any related concern is not a problem. It supports different operating systems including, Windows 10, Android, and Linux.

The embedded Arduino Leonardo 101 board comes with a six-axis accelerometer and a gyroscope built in. The customizability offered by the Arduino board makes this session board controller a very resourceful/powerful tool for casual uses.

Udoo X86 II Ultra is based on the new generation Quad Core 64-bit personal computer with the intel's X86 processor architecture.

With an energy consumption of about 5 to 6 Watts, the gigantic processor is concentrated in nanometers. The power can be provided via the VIN pins usually found on the board's head.

### Pros
Udoo X86 II Ultra session board has the following advantages:

#### Enormous RAM
Udoo X86 II Ultra comes with an 8GB built in RAM. The advanced version has 4GB of RAM while the basic one has 2GB of RAM. This makes the Udoo X86 II Ultra more powerful than most of the session board controllers on the market.

#### Efficiency
Udoo X86 II Ultra is capable of running software meant for a normal personal computer. This is made possible by a 2.56GHz quad-core intel CPU and an 8GB RAM.

#### Availability of freely useful guides and community
Through a helpful community even not all guides are available online.

###	Lower energy consumptions
The Arduino Leonardo 101 board requires less than 11 Watts of energy which makes it very energy efficient.

#### Large storage capacity
Udoo X86 II Ultra box comes with a 32GB embedded multimedia card. However, users might decide to upgrade the storage to fit their desire. Though expensive, an SSD card is usually the best option. Additionally, a micro-SD card can also be used as a storage media.

#### X86-compatible architecture
Udoo X86 II Ultra supports most operating systems including Linux, Windows and Android. For Linux and Android, the internal storage can be used as a read only memory with additional SATA `HDD/SSD/eMMC` drive used as /tmp and /home directories.

Udoo II X86 Ultra is also used a gaming emulator as it supports most retro gaming emulators available for a PC. It can also emulate new consoles like play-station II.

#### Decent GPIO support
The Udoo x86 Ultra comes with 28 `GPIO` ports in total which may seem few, but considering that it has an Arduino 101 embedded on it, this is a decent number.

The Arduino board has an in built functionality for what some pins can be used for (like a six-axis accelerometer and gyroscope) and it adds 12 additional GPIO pins. Several key communication protocols such as the two IIC, two UART, LPC and SDIO are also supported.

####  Easy and straightforward set up
Itâ€™s absolutely straightforward to set up. The installation guidelines for the supported operating systems are provided in hard-copy and video form.

#### Arduino compatible
Udoo x86 II Ultra comes with an embedded Arduino 101, with all upgrades enabled (including 6-axis accelerometer, gyroscope and Bluetooth).

#### Great media streaming potential
Udoo x86 II Ultra has a moderately high power that makes it a single-board computer for streaming media in a high quality. It is able to stream a 30Hz 4k video on at least three monitors through two mini display ports.

It also supports a set up for UHD capable media station with a wide variety of applications like Spotify, Netflix, YouTube, Kodi etc.

### Cons
Udoo X86 II Ultra might not the best choice for the following reasons:

#### Expensive
Udoo x86 II Ultra is relatively expensive compared to other session board controllers on the market.

#### Lack of official documentation
Apart from the hardware specifications sheet, there is no official documentation publicly available. Also, there is generally not too many project examples or information available on the official website for Udoo x86 II ultra at the moment. Therefore, users have a hard time finding out how to use the board.

#### 4K only supports 24 FPS
Only supports HDMI 1.4 and DP 1.1a, so 4K is limited to 24 FPS.

### Conclusion
Udoo x86 II Ultra is one of the best session board controllers in the market today. It has a wide range of capabilities and enhanced features. Udoo x86 II Ultra supports a wide range of operating systems as well.
