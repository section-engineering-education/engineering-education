### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Session board controllers

### Introduction to Udoo X86 II Ultra
Udoo X86 II Ultra session board controller power is comparable to that of a new typical personal computer in the market today. Udoo X86 II ultra comes embedded on the same platform with an Arduino Leonardo 101 board together with a more powerful X86 maker architecture.

Udoo X86 II Ultra is able to run most of the applications that one could run on day-to-day basis in personal computer world. These applications range from those for professional developments platforms to graphical editors, 3D gaming to video streaming, libraries, sketches and the official Arduino Leonardo IDE, plus all the applications present in the Arduino Leonardo space.

Udoo X86 II Ultra is a genuine computer. Hence, absence of drivers or any related concerns is not a problem anymore. It supports different operating systems including, on windows 10, android and Linux. The embedded Arduino Leonardo 101 board comes with built in with a six-axis accelemetor and a gyroscope. The customizability presented by the Arduino board together with the high power makes this Session Board controller a very resourceful tool for power and casual users.

Udoo X86 II Ultra session board controller is based on a Quad Core 64-bit personal computer new generation with the intel architecture of X86 processors. With an amount of energy consumption of 5 or 6 watts, the gigantic processor is concentrated in 1n nanometres. The power can also be provided with a VIN pin usually found on the head.

### Pros
*Huge RAM*
Udoo X86 II Ultra is built in with an 8GB RAM. The advanced version has 4GB of RAM while the basic has a 2GB of RAM. Generally, this makes the Udoo X86 II Ultra far much way more than most of the session board controllers on the market.

*Efficiency*
Udoo X86 II Ultra has the ability of running day to day activities of a normal Personal Computer. This is made possible with a 2.56 GHz quad-core intel CPU and a size of 8GB of RAM.

*Availability of freely useful guides and community*
Through a helpful community even not all guides are available online.
iv.	Lower energy consumptions
The Arduino Leonardo 101 board takes less than 11 watts of energy at any given time which makes it very energy efficient.

*Large storage capabilities*
Udoo X86 II Ultra box comes with a 32GB embedded multimedia card. Moreover, the user might decide to upgrade the storage they see fits them. Though expensive an SSD storage is usually the best option. Additionally, a microSD card might also be used as a storage.

*X86-compatible architecture*
It supports all operating systems that is Linux, windows and android. For Linux or android, the internal storage of 32GB might be used as read only and additional SATA HDD/SSD/eMMC drive as /tmp and /home directories.
Udoo II X86 Ultra is also used a gaming emulator as it supports almost all retro gaming emulators available for a Personal Computer. It can also emulate new consoles like playstation2.

*Decent GPIO support*
The Udoo x86 Ultra comes with 28 GPIO ports in total which may seem small, but considering the fact that it has an Arduino 101 embedded inside, it’s actually a decent amount. The Arduino board has built-in functionality for what some of the pins would be used (like a six-axis accelerometer and gyroscope) and adds 12 additional GPIO pins. Several key communication protocols are also supported: two IIC, two UART, LPC and SDIO.

*Set-up is easy and straightforward*
It’s absolutely straightforward to set up. The installation guides for all supported operating systems are provided in written and video form.

*Arduino compatible*
Udoo x86 II Ultra comes with an embedded Arduino 101, with all upgrades enabled (including 6-axis accelerometer, gyroscope and Bluetooth).
x. Great media streaming potential
Udoo x86 II Ultra has a moderately higher power that ensures its single-board computer for streaming media with a high-quality. Udoo x86 is able to stream a 30Hz 4k Video on at least three monitors though two mini display ports. It therefore supports a set up for UHD capable media station. It supports a wide variety of applications like Spotify, Netflix, YouTube, Kodi etc. This is made possible since Udoo X86 II Ultra is run on operating systems which support these applications. 

### Cons

*Expensive*
Udoo x86 II Ultra is relatively expensive.

*Lack of official documentation*
Apart from the hardware specifications sheet, there is no official documentation publicly available. Also, there is generally not too much project examples or information available from the official website for Udoo x86 II ultra at the moment. Therefore, users have a lot of work to do if they have to have any positive results from their projects.

*4K only supports 24 FPS*
Only supports HDMI 1.4 and DP 1.1a, so 4K is limited to 24 FPS.

### Conclusion
Udoo x86 II Ultra is one of the best session board controllers in the market. It has a wide range of capabilities and enhanced features. Udoo x86 II Ultra supports a wide range of operating systems including windows, linux and android.
