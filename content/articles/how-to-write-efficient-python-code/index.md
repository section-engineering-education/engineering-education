As a beginner programmer, writing efficient python code is not the main goal but rather to learn the basic syntax, the flow of the language, and how to think like a programmer. But things get interesting when you are trying to advance to an intermediate-level developer and become a true nerd, no pun intended.

Writing efficient python code is one way a beginner programmer can advance to become an intermediate programmer and appreciate code readability coupled with the productivity of a developer.

This tutorial is focused on teaching you how to write efficient python code. By the end of this tutorial, you will be equipped with the tools needed to improve your productivity as a developer. Tools we would use include `list comprehension`, `lambda`, etc.

### Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, a basic understanding of python is required. And a python interpreter should be installed in your local environment.

### List comprehension
List comprehension is a technique of creating a list containing data with a single line of code. It's common in various programming languages, including Python. 

Let's go over the syntax of list comprehension:

**result** = [**transform** **iteration** **filter**]

The *result* would be the final list containing our data, the *transform* is the value of each data in our list, it keeps on changing as the value of the iterator changes. The *iteration* is a loop that helps populate our list with the required amount of data. Finally, the *filter* (optional) is used to filter out the data that we don't want.

Before we take a look at an example of list comprehension, let's take a look at the traditional way of generating a list with data so we can compare the two ways:

```python
nums = []
for x in range(10):
    nums.append(x)

print(nums)
```

**Output:**

```bash
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
It took us about 3 lines of code. Let's try to be more efficient using `list comprehension`:

```python
nums = [x for x in range(10)]

print(nums)
```

**Output:**

```bash
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

Voil√†, just one line of code to achieve the earlier result. It is way quicker to write once you understand the syntax and flow of `list comprehension`.

Let's take a look at two more complex examples by adding *filters*:

```python
nums = [x for x in range(20) if x % 2 != 0]

print(nums)
```

**Output:**

```bash
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]
```

Another example:

```python
nums = ['True' if x % 2 == 0 else 'False' for x in range(10)]

print(nums)
```

**Output:**

```bash
['True', 'False', 'True', 'False', 'True', 'False', 'True', 'False', 'True', 'False']
```

With these two examples above, we added the ability to use the `if/else` statement in our list comprehension. It should be noted that the `elif` statement can't be used within list comprehension.

In this section, we learned about using list comprehension to generate a list with data. In the next section, we will take a look at `lambda` functions.


### Lambda functions
`Lambda` functions is a technique in Python to write our functions on a single line. They are regarded as anonymous (nameless) functions. They are also not suited for complex functions. Just like with list comprehension, they make our code small and concise.

Let's take a look at the syntax:

**lambda arguments: expression**

The value at the left is referred to as the arguments, while the values at the right are the expression. Let's break the syntax further:

*lambda* arguments: value_to_return *if* condition *else* value_to_return

Before we take a look at an example of lambda functions, let's take a look at an example of a regular function in Python so we can compare the two ways:

```python
def even_or_odd(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return "Even"
    else:
        return "Odd"

print(even_or_odd(10))
```

**Output:**

```bash
Even
```

This took us about five lines of code to write, with `lambdas` I'm happy to say that it'll only take one line:

```python
print((lambda n: "Even" if n % 2 == 0 else "Odd")(9))
```

**Output:**

```bash
Odd
```

We can also store them inside variables:

```python
even_or_odd = lambda n: "Even" if n % 2 == 0 else "Odd"
even_or_odd(8)
```

**Output:**

```bash
Even
```

If we store them inside a variable, we don't need to wrap parenthesis around the `lambda` function and the argument. The variable serves as the identifier to call the function.

In this section, we looked at `lambdas` which is a very quick way of writing a function. They don't work well for very complex functions. In the next section, we'll take a look at three very useful functions named `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

### Map, Filter and Reduce
When you are working with a list filled with data, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` give you the ability to perform common list manipulation tasks.

The first on the list is `map`. With the `map` function we can modify our list however we want. 

Let's take a look at an example:

```python
# Example of a map function
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

squared_nums = list(map(lambda x: x * x, nums))

print(squared_nums)
```

**Output:**

```bash
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

The map function takes two arguments, the function that would modify the data, and the data itself. In our example, we used the lambda function but we can use it without lambdas.

The `map` function coupled with the lambda function allows us to modify our list with just one line of code.

Note that we used the `list` function to convert map objects back to a list.

The second one is `filter`, the `filter` function is used to filter out unwanted data from our list.

Let's take a look at an example:

```python
# Example of a filter function
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

even_nums = list(filter(lambda x: True if x % 2 == 0 else False, nums))

print(even_nums)
```

**Output:**

```bash
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

In our example, we are filtering out the odd numbers.

The `reduce` function helps to reduce the items in our list to just one value.

Let's take a look at an example:

```python
# Example of a reduce function
from functools import reduce

nums = [5 ,6 , 7 ,8 , 9, 10]

sum_of_nums = reduce(lambda a,b: a + b, nums)

print(sum_of_nums)
```

**Output:**

```bash
45
```

In our example, we used the `reduce` function to add up all the data in our list.

Note that we have to import `reduce` from `functools` before we can use it.

The `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` save us time from creating our list manipulation function. They are useful for many common cases.

### Conclusion
I am glad that you have reached the end of this article, I encourage you to use the concepts you have been introduced within your next Python project and check out how it improves your efficiency as a developer.

Happy coding!
