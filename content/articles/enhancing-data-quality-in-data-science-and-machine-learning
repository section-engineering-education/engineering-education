### Introduction
Every data scientist and Machine Learning expert seeks to create a model that has very high predictive accuracy. In tuning hyper-parameters or improving modeling methods, data may be an issue. Therefore, irrespective of how powerful a Machine Learning model is, bad data will always lead to a mediocre result at best. More than half of data scientists consider cleaning and organizing data to be the least fun part of their job. It is no secret that data preparation is a vital but daunting operation in the data analytics process. A series of surveys of data scientists and experts have confirmed the common 80/20 rule which states that 80% of the time is spent on mundane janitorial tasks such as data collection, cleaning and finding insights from the data, leaving 20% for actual analytic work such as modeling and algorithm development. For data scientists, this can be a significant impediment to creating a useful model and for firms, this can be a significant drain on resources as the investment in data analytics only devoted one-fifth of the budget to the original goal.

### What is Data Quality? 

Data quality refers to the degree of the state of data based on some laid down factors such as thoroughness, validity, uniformity and reliability. It is a comparison of a data set's present state to the goal. The goal is that state where the data is considered fit for use, without loopholes, and meets the set requirements.
Have you heard of the term GIGO? Garbage in Garbage out? This is precisely what occurs here. Data scientists arrive at a task with a set of data and the purpose of building the best model to achieve the assignment's goal.
In data science and Machine learning, data quality is critical because the quality of the data utilized will determine how poor or effective the solutions become. Quality data yields quality outcomes and vice versa.
 
### How to achieve High Data Quality
To achieve high-quality data in data science and machine learning, a systematic approach and empirical approach must be adopted.
It is critical to follow the steps below when using the systematic approach;
- Understand the data quality problem- it is important to be informed of business requirements and the data quality itself.
 - Define the data quality category - it is vital to map those definitions to a framework and vividly spell out other high-level definitions on execution like who and when to be implemented.
 - Design a way to implement - there's a need to design a set of assessment requirements or criteria.
 - Assess the data to check for quality - this helps to determine good and bad data quality and ultimately report results and recommendations on improvement.
 
Without proper planning, a solid systematic approach alone will fail. To make a good plan, you must have a complete understanding of the business particularly when it comes to data quality issues. To achieve this, empirical approaches such as stakeholder surveys are used to determine which dimension is most important in relation to data quality issues.
 
A set of evaluation procedures should be implemented.. Design a process for implementing these stages so that the assessment based on specified dimensions can be mapped to actual data. The following 5 requirements can be used as example;
 
1. Timeframe - establish a time frame for collecting investigation data
2. Definition - establish a criterion for distinguishing between good and bad data.
3. Aggregation - this refers to how the data for assessment is quantified
4. Interpretability - a mathematical statement used to evaluate data
5. Threshold - choose a cut-off point for evaluating the findings.

Now that the assessment techniques are in place, it's time to go hands-on and conduct the evaluation. After the assessment, a process for evaluating the outcomes can be established. If the data quality is acceptable, the data can be used for further analysis. Otherwise, the data will have to be corrected and maybe obtained again. A pictorial illustration is shown below

### Conclusion
As seen in the article, there is no one for all solution for all data quality issues in data science and machine learning. In fact, half of the data quality element is highly subjective. However, we may always utilize a systematic approach to review and assess data quality in the process of data quality assessment. While this method is mostly objective and adaptable, it still necessitates some domain knowledge and that is where the empirical approach comes in.
