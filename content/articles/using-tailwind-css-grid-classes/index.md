CSS Grid is a layout system used in web design to layout UI elements of a web page using rows and columns. We can easily do this with Tailwind CSS. Tailwind CSS added a comprehensive set of utilities for working with CSS grid layout! 
<!--more-->
In this tutorial, we will learn how we can easily layout elements in our web page using the grid classes in Tailwind CSS. We will also learn how to make responsive designs for our elements using these classes.

Let's take a look at how they work.

### Prerequisites
In order to follow along this tutorial, a clear understanding of HTML and Tailwind CSS is essential.

We will not cover the basics of Tailwind CSS in this tutorial, but you can visit this [article](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/introduction-to-tailwind-css/) for the installation process.

Letâ€™s jump into it!

### Overview
In this tutorial we will go through the following:
1. Linking the project with Tailwind
2. Setting up the HTML
3. Grid row and columns classes and responsiveness
4. Grid row and column span classes
5. Grid gap classes and responsiveness

### Linking our Tailwind stylesheet
We will link our Tailwind stylesheet to our HTML project using `<link>` tag as shown below:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./src/tailwind.css">
</head>
</html>
```

### Our HTML
First, we will style the body using classes inside the `<body>` tag. You can choose any other color that is appealing to you. Then, we will set the height of our containment `<div>` using class, `min-h-screen` which means that the minimum height of the container is equal to 100 of the viewport.

We will then create another container inside the first container. This container will contain the elements which we will be laying out in rows and columns:

```html
<body class="bg-green-400">
    <div class="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center">
        <div class="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4 p-5">
            <div class="bg-green-100 text-green-500 text-lg font-bold text-center p-10 rounded-lg">1</div>
            <div class="bg-green-100 text-green-500 text-lg font-bold text-center p-10 rounded-lg">2</div>
            <div class="bg-green-100 text-green-500 text-lg font-bold text-center p-10 rounded-lg">3</div>
            <div class="bg-green-100 text-green-500 text-lg font-bold text-center p-10 rounded-lg">4</div>
            <div class="bg-green-100 text-green-500 text-lg font-bold text-center p-10 rounded-lg">5</div>
            <div class="bg-green-100 text-green-500 text-lg font-bold text-center p-10 rounded-lg">6</div>
            <div class="bg-green-100 text-green-500 text-lg font-bold text-center p-10 rounded-lg">7</div>
            <div class="bg-green-100 text-green-500 text-lg font-bold text-center p-10 rounded-lg">8</div>
            <div class="bg-green-100 text-green-500 text-lg font-bold text-center p-10 rounded-lg">9</div>
            <div class="bg-green-100 text-green-500 text-lg font-bold text-center p-10 rounded-lg">10</div>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
```

The following are the other classes that we have used: 
- `flex` aligns the elements side by side
- `items-center` and `justify-center` makes the elements appear at the center of the screen.
- `rounded-lg` make the edges of the elements have a rounded look.
- `bg-green-100` classes gives the elements a green background color.

We have now completely set our HTML and added Tailwind classes. This is how it looks like:

![Small Screen](/engineering-education/using-tailwind-css-grid-classes/image-sm.png)

![Medium Screen](/engineering-education/using-tailwind-css-grid-classes/image-md.png)

![Large Screen](/engineering-education/using-tailwind-css-grid-classes/image-lg.png)

As shown above, the layout of the elements changes depending on the screen size of the viewport. This is called responsiveness.

### Grid rows and columns and responsiveness
To be able to use grid classes, we need to start by giving the `<div>` container, the `grid` class as shown in the code above. This grid class controls the display type of this element.

In Tailwind CSS, responsiveness is achieved by the use of these `{screen:}` prefixes: `sm:` for small screen sizes, `md:` for medium screen sizes, and `lg:` for large screen sizes.

The `grid-col-2` utility that we have used sets the elements to be in two columns. This takes effect on all screen sizes. To change this to only take effect on small screen devices, we use the prefix, `sm:` before the class. The rows are automatically set to match the number of columns. We can also use `sm:grid-rows-5` to achieve the same result as per this example which we have ten elements.

The `md:grid-cols-3` utility sets the elements into three columns in medium screen devices by the use of `md:` before the grid class meaning medium screens. This class sets the elements into three columns and four rows.

The `lg:grid-cols-4` utility sets the elements into four columns in large screen devices only by the use of `lg:` before the grid class. This class sets the elements into three rows and four columns.

### Grid row-span and column-span classes
In Tailwind, the `col-span` class is used to specify the number of columns a cell should occupy. The `row-span-{n}` class is used to specify the number of rows that a cell should occupy. We set the number of rows or columns that a cell should span by adding a number in front of the class.

For example, if we want a cell to span two rows, then we use `row-span-2`, and if we wanted a column span of two, then we use `col-span-2` as shown below:

```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 p-5">
    <div class="shadow-lg bg-green-100 text-green-500 text-lg font-bold text-center p-10 rounded-lg row-span-2">1</div>
    <div class="shadow-lg bg-green-100 text-green-500 text-lg font-bold text-center p-10 rounded-lg">2</div>
    <div class="shadow-lg bg-green-100 text-green-500 text-lg font-bold text-center p-10 rounded-lg row-span-2">3</div>
    <div class="shadow-lg bg-green-100 text-green-500 text-lg font-bold text-center p-10 rounded-lg">4</div>
    <div class="shadow-lg bg-green-100 text-green-500 text-lg font-bold text-center p-10 rounded-lg col-span-3">5</div>
</div>
```

### Grid gap classes
The gap classes are used to add space between rows and columns. The gap classes include: `gap-{size}`, `gap-x-{size}` and `gap-y-{size}`. 
As for our case, we have used `gap-4`. This class adds space evenly between rows and columns. To use different rows and columns spacing, we use `gap-x-{size}` for column spacing and `gap-y-{size}` for row spacing. 

#### How it is used:
```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-5 gap-y-3">
  <div class="bg-green-100 text-green-500 text-lg font-bold text-center p-14 rounded-lg">1</div>
  <div class="bg-green-100 text-green-500 text-lg font-bold text-center p-14 rounded-lg">2</div>
  <div class="bg-green-100 text-green-500 text-lg font-bold text-center p-14 rounded-lg">3</div>
  <div class="bg-green-100 text-green-500 text-lg font-bold text-center p-14 rounded-lg">4</div>
</div>
```

#### Gap responsiveness
We can control gaps at specific screen sizes in Tailwind by adding a `{screen}:` prefix to any existing gap class. For example, use `md:gap-4` to apply a gap of 16px, that is, `gap-4` class at only medium screen sizes and `lg:gap-6` for  only large screen sizes, as shown below:

```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-2 md:gap-4 lg:gap-6 p-5">
    <div class="bg-green-100 text-green-500 text-lg font-bold text-center p-14 rounded-lg">1</div>
    <div class="bg-green-100 text-green-500 text-lg font-bold text-center p-14 rounded-lg">2</div>
    <div class="bg-green-100 text-green-500 text-lg font-bold text-center p-14 rounded-lg">3</div>
    <div class="bg-green-100 text-green-500 text-lg font-bold text-center p-14 rounded-lg">4</div>
</div>
```

### Conclusion
We have gone through several Tailwind CSS grid classes and how to implement them in a web page comprehensively. You can now create more and even better designs using Talwind grid layout classes on your own. 

Hope you find this tutorial was helpful.

Happy coding!
