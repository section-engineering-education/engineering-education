## Introduction
Fog computing is described as decentralizing computing and processing infrastructure by placing computing resources such as applications near the data source. This leverages the advantage of the cloud bringing its power closer to where data is produced and worked on. Often, edge computing is used interchangeably with fog computing due to the similar feature of bringing the processing and intelligence closer to the data.
Today, the fast-paced emergence of the Internet of Things has seen sensors and devices get connected and consequently resulting in the production of large amounts of data. Analysis of this data occurs in the cloud. However, due to latency, storage issues, and bandwidth, the introduction of fog computing as an extension of cloud computing has extended its services to the edge.

### Key takeaways
The objectives of this article are to help the reader understand:
1.	What is Fog computing.
2.	What are the main features of Fog computing.
3.	How does Fog computing solve the Internet of Things challenges.

## What is Fog Computing
While focusing on the Internet of things, one key challenge would be latency. Fog computing, which is originally a term by CISCO has had many definitions by various researchers. Essentially, it refers to the augmentation of the cloud acting as the proxy between the end devices and the cloud’s storage and computing services. Any device that has storage, network connectivity, and computing power can qualify to be a fog node. These devices are deployable anywhere having network connectivity. Examples of such devices are; surveillance cameras, industrial controllers, and embedded servers.

### Main features of fog computing
Fog computing has been considered to be an element of the cloud. The following describes the characteristics of fog computing:
1.	Low latency: Fog nodes are deployable anywhere. The closer the fog, the lower the latency experienced during data processing.
2.	Distributed geographically: unlike centralized cloud, where the services and applications are locally situated, the fog makes it easier for “anywhere distribution” as services and applications are distributed.
3.	Scalability: Fog computing is not limited and can work with large-scale sensor networks.
4.	Supports mobility: a key and essential aspect of fog applications are their ability to allow direct connections to mobile devices thus facilitating mobility methods that require distributed directory systems. An example of this is the locator ID separation protocol (LISP).
5.	Real-time processing: applications in the Fog allow real-time interactions among the fog nodes as opposed to batch processing used in the cloud.
6.	Heterogeneity: although the many end devices are manufactured by different manufacturers, they are all capable of connecting to the fog regardless of their platforms.
7.	Online analytics: the fog offers support for the analysis of data as its placed strategically between the cloud and the end devices, correlating data and processing it closer to the devices.

## Fog computing and the Internet of Things
IoT applications are facing great challenges with the current model in the centralized architecture of the cloud. For example, it is a challenge to support IoT applications with an aspect of time-sensitiveness especially as witnessed in augmented reality, video streaming, and online gaming. Moreover, the cloud lacks location awareness thus limiting where the devices can be deployed. IoT devices depend on a model where the data generated is processed and analyzed in real-time. 
Fog computing which offers different applications and is widely distributed efficiently offers the best package for IoT applications. Additionally, fog computing’s feature that supports large-scale sensor networks is ideal to support the ever-changing and increasing number of IoT devices.

### Application of fog computing in IoT
The following section describes examples of various areas where fog computing can been used in IoT applications:
1.	Connected car: lately, there has been a new trend of autonomous cars. These cars portray features such as hands-free control, self-parking functionalities, automatic steering, functions that heavily rely on real-time processing.
2.	Smart homes: the modern home has many devices and sensors all connected to work as one unit. These devices are unique in their makes, models, and platform. Moreover, some of the devices may generate and process huge amounts of data. Fog computing is thus ideal for solving many of the addressed concerns.
3.	Augmented reality: devices in augmented reality are becoming smaller, more ubiquitous, and faster. These categories of devices and applications are particularly sensitive to latency as a small gap affects the user experience. Fog computing and the cloud can be used as key players in this domain enabling latency-free applications.
4.	Smart traffic lights: fog computing enables smart traffic lights to sense pedestrians, vehicles, and cyclists, measuring their speed and distances, and turn on and off accordingly.

### How does Fog computing solve the Internet of Things challenges.
The following section describes various challenges faced by IoT devices and their applications and how fog computing can solve them:
1.	Latency: fog computing is ideal especially for time-sensitive applications that require minimum latency by performing processing and data analysis in real-time close to the end-users.
2.	Constraints in network bandwidth: The fog architecture is designed to allow hierarchical data processing along with the cloud through to the IoT devices. Consequently, this facilitates the processing of data based on the application demands and availability of computing and networking resources. Essentially, this reduces the overall data uploaded thus saving on the network bandwidth.
3.	Constraints in the resources of the devices: fog computing is ideal for operations requiring huge resources from devices with minimum resources.
4.	Uninterrupted services: even in situations where the connectivity to the cloud is irregular, fog computing can operate independently ensuring continuous services.

## Conclusion
IoT devices are rapidly increasing as they are used in almost all domains, become an important aspect of our lives. Having a common characteristic of their dynamic nature, limited processing and storage, they largely depend on cloud services. With traditional cloud computing, various challenges were faced. However, fog computing, an extension of the cloud, has been developed, solving the issue of latency as seen in latency-sensitive devices. As technology changes rapidly, fog computing integration with IoTs will continue to have many benefits.
