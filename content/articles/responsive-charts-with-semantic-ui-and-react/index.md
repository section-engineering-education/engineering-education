Graphical representation is one of the most prevalent methods to visualize and analyze data. The most common types of graphical representation of data are bar charts and bars graphs.
<!--more-->
Line and bar charts have various applications in data visualization and representation. Among the applications of these charts include statistics of user engagements, user growth, ratings of products, and other commodities.

This tutorial will walk through the various steps and dependencies required to build a responsive chart project. We will use React.js, semantic-ui, and CSS to generate line and bar charts with a set of coordinates and datasets.

Think of it as plotting a graph with a set of variables in mathematics but in this case, React.js.

### Key takeaways

After completing the tutorial, the reader should understand the following:
- Getting started with React functional components
- Installing and adding the semantic-UI dependency to your web project
- Creating reusable components with React.js
- Generating Line and Bar charts with react-chartjs-2
- Styling the components with CSS and semantic-ui

### Prerequisite
This tutorial requires intermediate knowledge of React.js, CSS, and any modern web styling libraries similar to Semantic-UI. So, for absolute beginners, take a moment and enrol in the [React crash course by Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101) here for free.

### Getting started with React functional components
React functional component is relatively a modern approach to React.js components. It was introduced in 2018, the former approach relying on class-based components. A functional component is a React function that accepts `props` and returns a JSX (JavaScript syntax extension). 

Props in React.js are arguments or parameters passed to a React component to be rendered. For this tutorial, we will adopt react functional components for our application.

To get started, we need to create the `chart-app`. Creating a react-app is done through the `create-react-app` command to get a basic outline of packages and files to run a React app. So, click open the command terminal and run the command below.

```bash
    npm create-react-app chart-app
```

Or for yarn users

```bash
    yarn create-react-app chart-app
```

If the command above is implemented correctly, the new React application should be set up and ready for development. This process takes a few minutes, so ensure the operation is completed before proceeding to the next step.

### Chart building overview
Creating responsive lines and bar charts with React.js alongside other dependencies will be subdivided into the following steps.
- Setting up the coordinate dataset
- Installing the required dependencies (react-chartjs-2 and semantic-UI.)
- Creating and setting up the chart component (Chart.js)
- Styling and viewing our application
  Now let us begin with our first step, shall we?

#### Setting up the coordinate dataset (Data.js)
The coordinate dataset is similar to the table of values when plotting a graph in algebra. It provides a set of numbers and labels for the chart components, which will be passed down as `props` and displayed.

To set up the coordinate dataset, we navigate to the `src` folder, then create a `Data.js` file. In the `Data.js`, we implement the code snippet below:

```JavaScript
let demoChart1 = {
  data1: (canvas) => {
    let vas = canvas.getContext("2d");
    let linearstroke = vas.createLinearGradient(0, 230, 0, 50);
    linearstroke.addColorStop(1, "rgba(7, 105, 204, 0.2)");
    linearstroke.addColorStop(0.4, "rgba(17, 135, 253, 0)");
    linearstroke.addColorStop(0, "rgba(29,140,248,0)");

    return {
      labels: [ "MON", "TUE", "WED", "THUR", "FRI", "SAT", "SUN",],
      datasets: [
        {
          label: "My cordinates",
          backgroundColor: linearstroke,
          borderWidth: 2,
          borderColor: "#085aa1",
          pointBackgroundColor: "#085aa1",
          pointBorderColor: "rgba(255,255,255,0)",
          pointBorderWidth: 15,
          pointHoverRadius: 4,
          pointRadius: 3,
          data: [70, 90, 105, 110, 85, 105, 115],
        },
      ],
    };
  },
  options: FirstChartOption,
};
module.exports = {
  demoChart1
};
```

In the above code snippet, we worked with canvas, which is used to render graphical elements in React.js.

- We create a 2D linear gradient and name it `linearstroke`. Then, we will use it to generate the line and bar charts with the dataset mentioned above.
- We also added some labels displayed at the bottom of the chart to provide names to the corresponding data, i.e. ("MON" representing 70, "TUE" representing 90).
- Finally, we added `border-width`, `border-color`, `background-color`, and other styles properties to the dataset. Those default properties should be provided to make the chart look good and presentable.

To conclude the coordinate setup, we need to create the arguments (options) we passed to the `demoChart` above. The option will provide the x and y-axis, responsiveness, scales, spacing, etc. To do that in the `Data.js` file, ship the code snippet above:

```JavaScript
let FirstChartOption = {
  maintainAspectRatio: false,
  legend: {
    display: false,
  },
  tooltips: {
    backgroundColor: "#f5f5f5",
    titleFontColor: "#333",
    bodyFontColor: "#666",
    bodySpacing: 4,
    xPadding: 12,
    mode: "nearest",
    intersect: 0,
    position: "nearest",
  },
  responsive: true,
  scales: {
    yAxes: [
      {
        barPercentage: 1.6,
        gridLines: {
          drawBorder: false,
          color: "rgba(29,140,248,0.0)",
          zeroLineColor: "transparent",
        },
        ticks: {
          padding: 20,
          fontColor: "#9a9a9a",
        },
      },
    ],
    xAxes: [
      {
        barPercentage: 1.6,
        gridLines: {
          drawBorder: false,
          color: "rgba(29,140,248,0.1)",
          zeroLineColor: "transparent",
        },
        ticks: {
          padding: 20,
          fontColor: "#9a9a9a",
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

Note: to fix a possible error that may occur, place the `FirstChartOption` we just created above the `DemoChart`. Because we are attempting to use a set of variables before it is declared, and React.js frowns at it.

We added `barpercentage`, `paddings`, `fontColors`, etc., to the chart in our options. As stated earlier, those are default properties provided to the chart component.

Take a look at the official documentation of [react-chartjs-2](https://github.com/reactchartjs/react-chartjs-2) for further clarity.

#### Installing the required dependencies

As you observed, we skipped installing the dependencies to set up our coordinate dataset. Whichever way you may choose to go about the project is okay. We are going to install the following dependencies to our application.

- [Semantic-ui-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-ui) and
- [React-chartjs-2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2)
  To install the above dependencies, open the `package.json` file and add the dependencies below:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "react-chartjs-2": "2.11.1",
    "semantic-ui-css": "^2.4.1",
    "semantic-ui-react": "^2.0.3"
  },
```

Once that is done, open up the `command terminal` and run the command below:

```bash
npm install
```

Or for yarn users:

```bash
yarn add
```

The command above should install the listed dependencies to our applicationâ€”time to utilize them in the next step.

#### Setting up the chart component (Chart.js)
The chart component will be set up using the react-chartjs-2 dependency we installed above and the coordinate dataset we created earlier. React-chartjs-2 provides line, bar, pie charts, etc., for importation and use.

In this tutorial, we will use line and bar charts. To create and set up our chart component, in our `App.js` file, clear the default boilerplate codes and replace them with the code snippet below:

```JavaScript
import React from "react";
import { Line, Bar } from "react-chartjs-2";
// semantic-ui components
import { Card} from "semantic-ui-react";
import {demoChart1} from "./Data.js";

function Chart() {
  const [demoChartData, setdemoChartData] = React.useState("data");

  return (
    <>
      <div className="container">
            <Card className="card-chart">
              <Card.Header>
                    <h5 className="card-details">Total Visits</h5>
                    <h2>Guests</h2>
              </Card.Header>
              <Card.Content>
                <div className="chart-zone">
                  <Bar
                    data={demoChart1[demoChartData]}
                    options={demoChart1.options}
                  />
                </div>
              </Card.Content>
            </Card>
            <Card className="card-chart">
                <h5 className="card-details">Total Inmates</h5>
              <Card.Content>
                <div className="chart-zone">
                  <Line
                    data={demoChart1.data}
                    options={demoChart1.options}
                  />
                </div>
              </Card.Content>
            </Card>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}

export default Chart;
```

Let us discuss what is happening with the code snippet we just shipped. First, we imported the dataset we created in the first step. Then, we imported the `Line,` and `Bar` (Line for line-chart and Bar for bar-chart) components from the `react-chartjs-2` library will be used to utilize the dataset and subsequently generate our charts.

- Secondly, we imported the Card component from the semantic-UI dependency we installed earlier. The Card component will act as a container from the charts and add additional styles and responsiveness.
- The Line and Bar charts accept two `props`, `data` and `options`. For the data, we pass down the `demoChart1.data` and then repeat the same for the option, replacing the data with options.
- The Line and Bar charts accept two `props`, `data` and `options`. For the data, we pass down the `demoChart1.data` and then repeat the same for the option, replacing the data with options.
- Finally, we exported the chart component for viewing on the browser window.


#### Styling and viewing our application
At this point, our application is ready for styling and viewing. Since most of the elements we used are from the `Semantic-UI design library`, default styles have already been added to the charts and texts, so we will add a few paddings and margins to keep things simple.

Feel free to take it way beyond the basic styles that we will add. Adding styles to the application is easy. Open the `App.css` file in the `src` folder, clear all the default styles, and replace them with the CSS snippet below.

```CSS
.container {
    padding-left: 30px;
    margin: 0;
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
  }

.chart-zone {
  padding: 10px 0 25px;
  height: auto;
  width: 100%;
}

.card-details {
  text-transform: capitalize;
  font-weight: 400;
  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6);
  font-size: 0.75rem;
}
```

We have successfully added a few styles to our application, i.e., `font-weight`, `color`, adjusted the `font-size`, added `width` and `height` of 100%, and finally, some `margin`, and `padding`.

That being done, it is time to view our application on the browser window. First, open up the command terminal on your text editor, be sure to be inside the `chart-app` root directory, then run the command to start the development server shown below:

```bash
npm start
```

Or for yarn users

```bash
yarn start
```

Once the development server is up and running, it will open a new tab on your default browser with beautiful-looking charts displayed.
