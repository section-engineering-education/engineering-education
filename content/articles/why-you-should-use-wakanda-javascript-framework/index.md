### Introduction
Wakanda is an open-source platform which authorizes the user to easily and quickly create applications that can be utilized on mobile applications and webs in JavaScript. This definition is sweet enough to catch interest but is obvious that developers donâ€™t fall for this line. Wakanda is supported on Microsoft windows, cloud-ready on back-end, Linux. 

### Features of Wakanda JavaScript Framework 
There are very nice features which make Wakanda JavaScript stand out in this modern Day. 

**Wakanda database**
The Wakanda Database itself stands out for me, especially when it is paired perfectly with the Wakanda Server. It has been able to offer same experience as that of Mongo and CouchDB since it uses modern NoSQL with similar portability as SQLite. Wakanda JavaScript framework saves stress and time since it is portable, ready to use. 

**Wakanda server**
Wakanda server runs and hosts the backend applications in the course of production and development It is a multi-threaded HTTP server which incorporates server-side JavaScript APIs unmasked in REST. Everything needed is already written to the users in JavaScript. It is also saving time since the user does mot have to go in configuration tasks. It is also portable. This Wakanda server lowers the cost of both configuration and development by using pre-bundled components; 

**JavaScript Application Server** 
It uses V8 which operates on JavaScript runtime. It exhibits a rich synchronous API to hold filesystems, sockets remote databases and workers. It support asynchronous coding style.

**HTTP server**
It exposes the autogenerated REST API of the Wakanda.it is also responsible for serving static application files.
Data Abstraction Layer
Its is essential for data security, helps in data manipulation through use of JavaScript API, exposes an automated REST API to manipulate and access data.
**Authentication (directory)**
It helps in exposing both the REST API and server side JavaScript API.it is responsible for authentication of management sessions and users.

**Wakanda studio**
Wakanda studio helps to develop and test apps locally together with troubleshooting your environment. In this era where everyone is craving for a code editor Wakanda has taken a different turn of coming up with IDE. Wakanda's main objective is to give a quick and easy way in project scaffolding. Wakanda is the solution. The philosophy behind this Wakanda studio which simplifies developers lives who have decided to work with Wakanda JavaScript framework stack is called RAD (Rapid Application Development). Do you love react? You can change scaffolding your project and adapt it as you desire. Wakanda identifies and acknowledges the three critical parts in all the application. These crucial parts are all used in initial scaffolding. They include backend, web and the mobile. Studio has a code editor emanating from extension updatable, an application prototype, deploy solutions, code mirror and git integration. This studio gives the user the whole view of application;

 **Application scaffolding**
It composes your app by identifying templates from the configured list. This includes Backend: typescript, JavaScript. web: Angular1, Angula4 but soon ReactJS and Aurelia are coming. Mobile: Ionic1, Ionic2.

**Environmental troubleshooting**
System and tools configuration problems detection and also solutions are readily prepared for you. This will help in creating value thus choosing Wakanda JavaScript framework. 

### Why you should use it? 
- It is cost effective. This is due to some of its parts being reusable modules, its easy amalgamation between the developmental phases of application development and backend prototyping. 
- Wakanda is standardized for simplified deployment and easy maintenance. 

- Wakanda JavaScript framework is uniquely built. It brings together various application which the user needs for building, deploying, and prototyping in a single environment. 

- In Wakanda, cross-platform mobile and web applications can be built quickly. 

- Wakanda being an open-source platform it is progressive so that developers make all possible choices. This means developers can take control when need be, write their code or use the available existing tools and components. 
- Its compatibility with all technologies make this JavaScript Framework stand out in the market. It is integrated with databases and frameworks of all kinds. Wakanda components can be stocked by developers or rather modify them. 

### Conclusion 
To sum up, Wakanda JavaScript framework as discussed above is recommendable to developers for it has good features which are user friendly.The Wakanda framework also supports cross-platform applications. This means that you can use the framework to craft beautiful applications for mobile and web platforms.  Therefore, head over to the Wakanda Framework and try it hard.
