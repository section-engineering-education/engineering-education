Advances in automation have led to the emergence of intelligent systems that facilitate the quick performance of basic and repetitive tasks. 

Intelligence automation combines [robotic process automation](/engineering-education/what-is-robotic-process-automation/) (RPA) with [artificial intelligence](/engineering-education/differences-between-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-and-deep-learning/) (AI) to maximize automation for business organizations. The combination of several processes, including machine learning, AI, RPA, and several other core technologies, are responsible for making automation smart.

This article will discuss the primary technologies that make automation smart and discuss the value and the future of intelligent automation.

### What is intelligent automation?
Intelligent automation is a class of information technology automation tools that use machine learning, robotic automation, and AI. Together, these systems automate complex tasks and perform more adaptable workflows. 

Machine learning uses algorithms to make data outcome predictions. These algorithms use statistical analysis to identify trends, commonalities, and [correlations between variables](https://www.advsyscon.com/blog/intelligent-automation/). They then use the identified patterns to determine future events. In addition, these algorithms keep changing to factor in any slight changes in data for better predictions.

On the other hand, AI helps make decisions automatically using features that mimic human capabilities. Intelligent automation goes beyond the performance of basic and repetitive tasks to encompass tasks that require cognitive processing.

### Core technologies that make automation smart
The main technologies that make automation more intelligent include:
- Cognitive agents
- Natural-language generation
- Machine learning and advanced analytics
- Smart workflow
- Robotic process automation

Let us discuss each of these technologies in detail.

#### Cognitive agents
Cognitive agents deliver value to businesses by automating transactional tasks. These agents automate tasks that relate to decision-making and provide an intelligent user experience. 

They enhance the automation process in different ways, including decision-making, self-learning, and bridging enterprise systems.

Cognitive agents make decisions by processing a wide range of human inputs. They process large masses of data and make decisions that influence a firm's operations. Cognitive agents' ability to self-learn derives from tapping into machine learning functionality.

In other words, cognitive agents make automation smoother with time by keeping up with the current trends and avoiding repeating previous errors. 

In addition, these technologies connect the front end to the back-end systems using a natural language interface. This connection enhances interlinking within an organization while also improving the execution of complex actions across a system.

#### Natural-language generation
Natural language generation (NLG) is another critical technology in automation. It entails using AI to generate language for different purposes. 

For example, NLG systems have become increasingly important in creating chatbots designed for customer service and automated answering services, such as [Siri](https://www.apple.com/siri/). 

These systems make automation easier by mimicking language processes similar to human speech.

#### Machine learning and advanced analytics
Machine learning and advanced analytics make the automation process efficient. You create a self-optimizing network by taking advantage of ML and advanced technologies. 

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses powerful algorithms to enable computers to learn without relying on programming and reprogramming. It allows organizations to gain insights into solving business problems. 

It uses different techniques, such as [transfer learning](/engineering-education/NLP-transfer-learning/), [natural language processing](/engineering-education/five-real-life-use-cases-of-natural-language-processing-NLP/), [deep learning](/engineering-education/introduction-to-deep-learning/), clustering, and word embedding.

Machine learning has several applications in automation, including speech recognition and signals diagnosing. 

In biometrics, ML helps in face detection and image classification. The retail sector, in particular, has begun utilizing machine learning technology due to its several automation benefits. 

For example, ML makes it possible for websites to recommend various items for purchase to their consumers. It analyzes consumer buying behavior and automatically uses the determined patterns to target them during advertising.

Advanced analytics are also crucial in automation. They combine smart automation with data analysis to eliminate the manual labor force during supplier onboarding and screening. In addition, advanced analytics make the automation process simple in document collection and supplier selection. 

Advanced analytics enable the procurement processes to automate document workflow. They also allow faster intelligent risk assessments and automation of [out-of-compliance](https://procurementandsupply.com/2019/12/why-smart-automation-and-advanced-analytics-go-hand-in-hand/) and expiring contracts.

Buyers can get information that helps them make guided purchasing decisions from these advanced analytics. Advanced analytics has a cognitive tool that samples market intelligence and provides buyers with information.

#### Smart workflow
Smart workflow plays a significant role in making automation smart. 

Workflow refers to a sequence of events happening from start to finish to accomplish a particular activity. It factors the source of information, the method, program, path, and end-point. Having a smart flow makes the process of automation possible. 

Smart Workflow is a [prepackaged](https://www.smarterp.com/solutions/information-technology/smart-workflow) solution built to meet specific routing and rules needs, even when business requirements change. In addition, making a workflow automatic allows the recipient of information to trigger particular actions already defined beforehand, making operations run smoothly.

A smart workflow fulfills the underpinning goals of automation in IT. It increases productivity while getting rid of redundancy during tasks. 

Smart workflow reduces delays in information dissemination while also making it flexible enough to meet changing business demands. It makes data management easy for a business firm, enhancing its performance.

#### Robotic process automation
Robotic process automation (RPA) is at the heart of automation. 

It makes it possible to create, deploy, and manage software robots that perform intelligent actions mimicking human actions. These robots can comprehend things, such as information appearing on the monitor, navigate database systems, extract data, and follow commands. 

RPA makes software advantageous because it can perform human-computer actions more consistently than people.

Besides, robotic process automation makes the process of automation more efficient because it works using principles of logic. 

For example, with RPA, a robotic system can capture and interpret applications for processing transactions and manipulate data to communicate with other digital systems. 

RPA helps accomplish simple tasks like automated responses on email and more complex ones like deploying hundreds of bots. In addition, robotic process automation helps streamline automatic services and ensures that operations happen fast and smoothly.

### The value of intelligent automation
#### Reduces costs of operation and improves productivity
The value of intelligent automation is found in its benefits to organizations. It reduces the costs of operation and improves productivity in companies. Intelligent automation reduces the risks of running businesses because of improved data analysis in business organizations. 

Automated systems collect as much data as possible and analyze it to the tiniest detail to obtain accuracy. This accuracy is vital in accelerating production while minimizing the risks without compromising the quality of a particular product. 

Besides, intelligent automation means that machines can perform activities that previously required human labor. Their machine learning capabilities help companies employ fewer people, thus saving on the expenses or running a large workforce.

#### Improves accuracy
Intelligence automation also improves accuracy, which promotes product quality. Using artificial intelligence, the decision-making processes rely on reliable market data analytics, reducing the margin for error. So, they enhance consistency in approaches used to perform repetitive tasks.
