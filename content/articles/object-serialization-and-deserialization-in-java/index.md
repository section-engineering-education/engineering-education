In this tutorial, we will go through how serialization works and how we can implement it. We will also look at examples of how we can serialize a data structure using various Java concepts.
<!--more-->
`Serialization` in Java is a byte-stream representation of an entity's state. All the entity's data is inside the stream of bits. `Deserialization` is the reversal of serialization, in which a byte data type stream is turned back to a memory object. The best thing about both techniques is that they're both JVM-agnostic, which means you can serialize on one JVM and de-serialize on another.

### Characteristics of serialization

- Machine Independent: On a separate device you can deserialize any encapsulated item.
- Inheritance: When a parent class is serializable, all its subclasses become serializable as well.

#### Why serialization?

- To transfer objects through a network.
- To keep Java objects in memory.
- To save Java objects in files.

### Benefits of serialization

- Allows the transfer of an object over a network.
- The status of an entity becomes saved or persistent.
- Independent of the JVM.
- It's simple to comprehend and personalize.

#### When utilizing serialization in Java, please remember the following:

- There are no methods or data members in the `Serializable` interface.
- Only use the Serializable interface to serialize an object.
- A class's fields must all be serializable; otherwise, use the `transient` keyword.
- The child class does not need to implement the Serializable interface if its parent class does.
- During the serialization process, only preserve non-static data members; static and transient data members are not.
- The String and its wrapper classes have the Serializable interface implemented by default.

### How to serialize and deserialize with the help of examples

To perform serialization, use the `ObjectOutputStream` class's `writeObject` method. For deserialization, use the `InputObjectStream` class's `readObject` method.
The `.ser` extension is usually used when serializing an entity to a file in Java.

Method syntax of writeObject:

```java
public final void writeObject(Object o) throws IOException
```

Method syntax readObject:

```java
public final Object readObject() throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException
```

> We are going to use sections of our full example code which will be shown later. Below are the sections of the full code. 

#### A Serialization example

Consider this, `Link` class, which contains two data members: `commons` and `favorites`. This is how we will define it:

```java
import java.io.*;

class Link implements Serializable {

    private String commons;
    protected int favorites;

    public Link(String commons, int favorites) {
        this.commons = commons;
        this.favorites = favorites;
    }

    public void printLink() {
        System.out.println("Link : " + this.commons);
    }

}
```

To serialize this class, we first need to implement the `java.io.Serializable` interface to mark it as serializable.

```java
class Link implements Serializable
```

We then implement the following method:

```java
public static void serializeLink(Link inputLink, String fileName) throws IOException {

    FileOutputStream file = new FileOutputStream(fileName);
    ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(file);
    out.writeObject(inputLink);
    out.close();
    file.close();

}
```

#### Description

This function will serialize a `Link` object submitted as a parameter. The serialized bytes are then written to a file in which we will specify the name as the second parameter.  Handle Serialization via `out.writeObject(inputLink)`.  By calling `file.close()`, we terminate the file handle.

#### Deserialization example

The serialized object may now be deserialized by using the technique listed below.

```java
public static Link deserializeLink(String fileName) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {

    FileInputStream file = new FileInputStream(fileName);
    ObjectInputStream on = new ObjectInputStream(file);
    return (Link) on.readObject();

}
```

#### Description

The `deserializeLink()` method has one parameter. The parameter name is `filename`, which is the location where we save the deserialized object.

1. The file will open in input mode using this procedure.
2. We perform deserialization using `in.readObject()`.
3. After that, the outcome will be classiÔ¨Åed as a Link object.

If the item is not present, the above procedure may throw an `IOException`. When the expected class is not found, we issue a `ClassNotFoundException`.

#### Object Serialization and Deserialization Example

Here is the full code from the previous sections of serialization and deserialization.

**Serialization.java**

```java
import java.io.*;
class Link implements Serializable {
    private String commons;
    private int favorites;
    public Link(String commons, int favorites) {
        this.commons = commons;
        this.favorites = favorites;
    }
    public void printLink() {
        System.out.println("Link : " + this.commons);
    }
}
public class Serialization {
    public static void serializeLink(Link inputLink, String fileName) throws IOException {

        FileOutputStream file = new FileOutputStream(fileName);
        ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(file);
        out.writeObject(inputLink);
        out.close();
        file.close();

    }
    public static Link deserializeLink(String fileName) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {

        FileInputStream file = new FileInputStream(fileName);
        ObjectInputStream on = new ObjectInputStream(file);
        return (Link) on.readObject();

    }
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
        Link randomLink = new Link("My first link", 5);
        final String filename = "example.bin";
        System.out.println("Prior to Serialization : ");
        randomLink.printLink();
        serializeLink(randomLink, filename);
        Link linkFromFile = deserializeLink(filename);
        System.out.println("Following Serialization : ");
        linkFromFile.printLink();
    }
}
```

#### Output

```
Before Serialization : 
Link : My first link
After Serialization : 
Link : My first link
```

### How to use inheritance to serialize an object in Java

When we mark a parent class as serializable, all its subclasses are implicitly serializable. Thus, you don't need the subclasses to implement the Serializable interface directly.

#### Example

```java
import java.io.*;

class Link implements Serializable {

    private String commons;
    protected int favorites;

    public Link(String commons, int favorites) {
        this.commons = commons;
        this.favorites = favorites;
    }

    public void printLink() {
        System.out.println("Link : " + this.commons);
    }

}
class SerialLink extends Link {
    protected String commits;

    public void addCommit(String newCommit)
    {
        if (this.commits == null) commits = "";
        this.commits += (newCommit + ",");
    }

    public String getCommit() {
        return this.commits;
    }

    public SerialLink(String commons, int favorites) {
        super(commons, favorites);
    }
}
```

#### Description

There are two classes in the example above: `Link` and `SerialLink`. `SerialLink` derives from `Link` and has a `commits` data member that contains all the commits left on the link. Due to the concept of Multilevel Inheritance, `Link` implements `Serializable`, and so `SerialLink` will become serializable as well. However, this idea does not operate in reverse as a result. When a child class implements the Serializable interface, the Parent class is not affected.

### Serialization with aggregation

To establish a *HAS-A* connection in Java, we utilize aggregation. This implies that a single class may refer to many different other classes. These classes won't be serializable until all of their references are of type `Serializable`. Any attempt to serialize these types fails due to `NotSerializableException`.

#### Example

```java
class Link {
    private String heading;
    private String commons;
    public String getlink() {
        return this.commons + " : " + this.link;
    }
}
class Seriallink {
    private link link;
    private int favorites;
}
```

#### Description

In the illustration above, if a client wants to serialize the `SerialLink` object, a `NotSerizalizableException` will be produced. Since `link` cannot be serialized until the `Serializable` interface has been implemented, this error will occur.

When properties aren't serialized, there are a couple of things to consider:

1. Static members
2. Transient members

### Serialization with static data members

Static members/variables belong to a class unlike instance members/variables which belong to an object. Importantly, serialization only preserves the state of an object, not the value of a static component of a class.

As the static member belongs to its class and isn't a part of the object of its class, the values of the static member aren't stored when an object is serialized.

### Transient members

In some circumstances, the client does not desire all the data members of an entity for serialization. For this use scenario, Java includes the keyword `transient`. Any data member declared as transient in the serialized object will have a default value for its data type.

#### Example

```java
class Link implements Serializable {
    public String commons;
    public transient int commits;
    public Link(String commons, int commits) {
        this.commons = commons;
        this.commits = commits;
    }
    public void printLink() 
    {
        System.out.printf("Link : \"%s\" with %d commits.%n", this.commons, this.commits);
    }
}
// Use the class as in our previous serialization example
```

#### Output

```
Before Serialization : 
OurLink: "My first link" with 5 commons.
After Serialization : 
OurLink: "My first link" with 0 commons.
```

#### Description

After serialization, the number of comments went from 5 to null which is a 0. This occurs since the comments are marked as temporary, thus their value is set to the int datatype's default value of 0.

#### Case in Point

Some variables may have big values that are difficult to convey over a network. As a result, we classify those numbers as temporary. Furthermore, if a client does not wish to publish or save a variable's value, considering it too minor or too personal, we can mark those variables as transient.

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have gone over serialization and deserialization. We solidified this knowledge using examples where we can apply distinct Java principles. Along the way, we went through the OOP concept of inheritance and aggregation. Finally, we discussed the circumstances when properties are not serialized.
