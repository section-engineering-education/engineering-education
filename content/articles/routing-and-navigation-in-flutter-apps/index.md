### Introduction
Navigating in Flutter apps, all you have to do is use the default navigation that comes with Flutter. For complex Flutter, applications consider the addition of dynamic links, authorizations, and authentication. GetX does a good job of helping you with this by using middleware and bindings, child routes.
### Topics to handle
- learn the usage of navigator, routes in Flutter.
- Passing between one page to another.
- Learn how to put in place navigator and routes API.
- Create a Flutter application to show the usage of navigators and routes. 
### Disclaimers
- By default, the MaterialApp widget has a routes property. 
- Navigator 2.0 is also referred to as the router.
- DefaultTransitionDelegate helps the navigator to decide the transition of the screens. 
### Definition of Navigator and Routes as used in Flutter
- Navigator is a component that manages a stack made of routes. This feature allows the user to transit from one screen to another. Navigator performs these transitions either by declarative or Imperative Api or Navigator. pages. Navigator.push and Navigator.pop are the most common method used. Stack of routes means that once you navigate from one page to another you can always go back to the previous page.
- Route -A route defines the navigation of the app. It tells which page the navigator takes the user to. Routes made of screens and pages.
	To navigate through apps screen,one can navigate using Navigator.push(),navigator.pop().
### Prerequisites
- Have Visual Studio Code or android studio installed.
- Understand how to code Flutter widgets.
- Under flutter basics.
- Understand widgets and how to import packages in Flutter.
 
### Types of navigator
- Using named routes. One of the best ways to manage many routes is using references. One can refer to a route either by Name, convention, or path.
To map navigator route one uses builder functions. Material app uses this style to create value for callback methods.

Illustration using code to show route names:

```dart
void main() {
 runApp(MaterialApp(
 home: MyFirstApp(), //represent the '/' route
 routes: <String, WidgetBuilder> {
 '/firstpage': (BuildContext context) => My_page(title: 'firstPage'),
 '/second': (BuildContext context) => My_Page(title: 'Secondpage'),
 '/thirdpage': (BuildContext context) => My_Page(title: 'thirdpage'),
 },
 ));
}
```
- Using navigator.pop:
	To create a new route to a new page using this method :
 
```dart
 Navigator.pop(context);
```
- Using navigator.push:
	To create a new route to a new page using this method :
 
```dart
 Navigator.push(context);
```
### Example to understand this better
Take a case for an application used by users to stream songs or videos. When a user taps on a song from a list of many songs, the new screen that pops up contains more details about the tapped one.
 
 
 
### Simple application that uses navigators and routes
 
For our application, we will have 3 screens. Navigator.push used navigate to the next page, Navigator.pop used to return to the previous page.
	1. Create a new Flutter application
 Open your visual code. On the menu bar click on `view` then `command palette` then click on `new flutter project`. Specify the location where to create your project then specify the name of your project. You can also create using the vs code terminal by typing 
```cmd
	flutter create name_of_project 
```
3. Open main. dart file and erase its content and replace it with this code.This case it uses named routes for all three screens. It contains named routes of all the pages we have in our application.
```dart
	//start by importing packages and pages	
import 'allfiles.dart';
void main() {
 runApp(const ThisApp());
	}

class ThisApp extends StatelessWidget {
 const ThisApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);
	
 @override
 Widget build(BuildContext context) {
 return MaterialApp(
 debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
 title: 'First Screen',
 home: const FirstScreen(),
 routes: {
 FirstScreen.routeName: (context) => FirstScreen(),
 Secondscreen.routeName: (context) => const Secondscreen(),
 Thirdscreen.routeName: (context) => const Thirdscreen(),
 },
 );
 }
}
	
```
3. Coding first page.
 Create firstscreen.dart . This file represents the first page of our application. It contains a class that has an app bar, text, and button to navigate to the second screen. This case uses a navigator. push to navigate to the next page.
```dart
import 'allfiles.dart';
class FirstScreen extends StatelessWidget {
 static const routeName = '/FirstScreen';
 const FirstScreen({Key? key}) : super(key: key);	
 @override
 Widget build(BuildContext context) {
 return const Scaffold(
 body: MyDetails(),
 );
 }
	}
	
	class MyDetails extends StatelessWidget {
 const MyDetails({Key? key}) : super(key: key);
	
 @override
 Widget build(BuildContext context){
 return Center(
 child: Column(
 mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,//aligns the cloumn to the center
 crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
 children: [
 Text('First Screen'),
 const SizedBox(
 height: 30,
 ),
 ElevatedButton(
 onPressed: () {
 Navigator.pushNamed(context,Secondscreen.routeName);
 },
 child: const Text('Go to Second Screen'),
 ),
 ],
 ),
 );
 }
}
	
```
5. Let's create the Secondscreen. dart. This is the second screen of our application. It contains text and two buttons to navigate to the first and third screens. The first button uses the `navigator. push(context)` to help navigate to the third screen while the second button uses the `navigator. pop(context)` to navigate back to the previous page. 
```dart
import 'allfiles.dart';
class Secondscreen extends StatelessWidget {
 static const routeName = '/Secondscreen';
 const Secondscreen({Key? key}) : super(key: key);
	
 @override
 Widget build(BuildContext context) {
 return Scaffold(
 body: Center(
 child: Column(
 mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
 children: [
 const Text('This is the Second Screen'),
 const SizedBox(
 height: 30,
 ),
 ElevatedButton(
 onPressed: () {
 Navigator.pushNamed(context,Thirdscreen.routeName);
 },
 child: const Text('Go to third screen'),
 ),
 const SizedBox(
 height: 10,
 ),
 ElevatedButton(
 onPressed: () {
 Navigator.pop(context);
 },
 child: const Text('Go to back'),
 ),
 ],
 ),
 ),
 );
 }
}
	
```
6. Let's create the third screen. dart. This is the last page of our Flutter mobile application. It also contains text and two buttons to navigate to the first and second screens. The first button uses the `navigator. push(context)` to help navigate to the first screen while the second button uses the `navigator. pop(context)` to navigate back to the previous page. 
```dart
import 'allfiles.dart';	
class Thirdscreen extends StatelessWidget {
 static const routeName = '/Thirdscreen';
 const Thirdscreen({Key? key}) : super(key: key);
	
 @override
 Widget build(BuildContext context) {
 return Scaffold(
 body: Center(
 child: Column(
 mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
 children: [
 const Text('This is the Third Screen'),
 const SizedBox(
 height: 30,
 ),
 ElevatedButton(
 onPressed: () {
 Navigator.of(context).push(MaterialPageRoute(
 builder: (context) => const FirstScreen()));
 },
 child: const Text('Go to firstScreen'),
 ),
 const SizedBox(
 height: 10,
 ),
 ElevatedButton(
 onPressed: () {
 Navigator.pop(context);
 },
 child: const Text('Go to Second Screen'),
 ),
 ],
 ),
 ),
 );
 }
}
	
```
7. Create allfiles.dart. It contains all the exports of all other files.It's used as one import to reduce repitition of imports.
```dart
export 'package:flutter/material.dart';
export 'firstscreen.dart';
export 'Secondscreen.dart';
export 'Thirdscreen.dart';
```
1. To run the Flutter app use the following commands:
```cmd
	flutter run -d chrome //runs the Flutter app in chrome browser
```
or you can run using a browser
```cmd
	flutter run -d edge //runs the Flutter app in the edge browser
```

### Conclusion
 
The navigators and routing in Flutter applications are key to Flutter application development. I recommend all Flutter developers to use navigator developing mobile and web applications.
