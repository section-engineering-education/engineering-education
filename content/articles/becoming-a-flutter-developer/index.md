`Flutter` is an open-source UI software development kit that `Google` released in 2018. It uses Dart as its primary programming language. Flutter has led to the emergence of new software developers called `Flutter Developers`.

### Introduction
Cross-platform applications enable companies to cut down on development costs. They eliminate the need to hire different software development teams. These applications also save time since there is only a single code base to manage. 

Flutter enables developers to create cross-platform applications. Due to these reasons, the need for Flutter Developers will continue to rise in the foreseeable future.

### Who is a Flutter developer
A Flutter developer is an individual who uses the Flutter framework to develop cross-platform applications. 

### Roles and responsibilities of a Flutter developer
#### To code applications
Flutter developers use the `Flutter SDK` to craft beautiful and interactive applications.

#### To test applications
Flutter developers have to test applications to make sure they do not crash. Testing also ensures that the apps adhere to system and user requirements.

#### To deliver applications
Flutter developers are involved in the deployment of applications. A mobile app is uploaded on `Google Play` for Android applications or `App Store` for iOS applications. User feedback is then monitored and used to make changes to the applications.

### Flutter developer tools
#### Version control tools
These tools allow software developers to keep track of the changes they make on their projects. They also boost collaboration among software developers. As a result, they help increase overall productivity. 

Examples of version control tools:
- [Git and Github](https://github.com/) - To use git, you will need to download and install it to the Code Editor or IDE you are using. Please note that you require a Github account to access its features. All you need to do is write git commands to push your code to a Github repository. Other developers can access the repository (if public) and thus, help you improve your code. You can also set your repository as private.

- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)

#### Flutter framework
Flutter is a UI framework used to develop high performance and high-quality native applications for Android, iOS, web and desktop using a single code base. Dart is the primary programming language for Flutter Framework. 

Some features of Flutter that make it popular include: 
- `Hot Reloading` - It enables developers to load code changes quickly and preserves the app's state. 
- `Hot Restart` - It is similar to hot reloading but causes the app to lose its state and takes more time.
- Availability of widgets which can be imported into Flutter projects easily.

Flutter also supports major UI designs. 

These are: 
- Cupertino (iOS).
- Material Design (Android). 

These built-in features enhance the development of Flutter applications. They also allow the apps to look and feel like native applications. 

#### Integrated Development Environment
The three popular IDEs that support Flutter are:
- [Android Studio.](https://developer.android.com/studio?gclid=CjwKCAiAr6-ABhAfEiwADO4sfa1AfvuxdsipeSb6kBcErdXuclAHU1HAFag4_R_xPfuDJzQRnWUP5hoCrewQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
- [Visual Studio Code.](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [IntelliJ IDEA.](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/promo/?gclid=CjwKCAiAr6-ABhAfEiwADO4sfRBLM6b-L-B5-iVm6zWaAiu9kI-sxLyz7GrdXxHBEoBDIGo4OvAFBBoChboQAvD_BwE)

Most Flutter developers pick either `Android Studio` or `Visual Studio Code`. They chose IDEs depending on the features suitable to them. Note that Android Studio and Visual Studio Code support the development of full Flutter apps.

#### Flutter DevTools
This is a tooling web suite for Flutter and Dart developers comprising layout inspection, performance, and memory tools. It contains all the debugging tools that you need to be an effective Flutter developer.

Some of the tools in the [Flutter DevTools web suite](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/devtools/overview) include:
- `Flutter Inspector` - It is used to diagnose and debug layout issues.

- `Timeline` - It diagnoses performance problems which often occur during development. Timeline shows the amount of time taken by each widget to render.

#### Design tools
These are tools used to craft and visualize ideas. Design is an important part of app development. It supports a smooth software development process. Design tools are also helpful when working on personal projects.

Here are some of the most popular design tools:
- [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/): This is only available for Mac users.
- [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) 
- [Flutter Studio](https://flutterstudio.app/)

### Flutter developer skills
#### Dart programming language
`Dart` is a client-based programming language that is scalable and can be used to write simple scripts. It is an object-oriented and dynamic language. Flutter developers must be familiar with Dart to create powerful applications.

#### Knowledge on Agile and Waterfall methodology for software development
A software development process involves different phases. For instance, there are idea generation and design stages. 
The most commonly used software development methodologies are `Waterfall` and `Agile`.

- `Waterfall Methodology` is a system development lifecycle model used to create a system with a linear and sequential approach.
- `Agile Methodology` is also a system development lifecycle model that implements iteration during testing and development throughout the cycle.

A Flutter developer needs to familiarize themselves with these software methodologies to work with ease in a software development team.

#### Prior knowledge on a Native Language

The native languages for mobile application development include:
- `Swift` for iOS applications.

- `Java` and `Kotlin` for Android applications.

Understanding these languages will make it easier to become a Flutter developer.

### Mistakes to avoid when learning Flutter development
- **Ignoring native languages:**
Most software developers will argue that prior knowledge in a native language is unnecessary. However, this is still a requirement for most job descriptions. Since Flutter development is still fairly new, employers must have proof that you know about application development. The only way to show this is by having experience with native languages such as Java, Swift, or Kotlin. In other words, knowing a native language may give you an advantage over a person who only knows Flutter and Dart. 

- **Over-relying on one source to develop your career as a Flutter Developer:**
Flutter and Dart are still fairly new technologies. Relying on a single tutorial or reading material to kick off your career might not give you sufficient knowledge. It is advisable to look into multiple resources to get a good grasp of Flutter and Dart. Different tutors have unique experiences and information on the framework.

- **Learning Flutter generally:**
Avoid confusion when trying to get into a new profession. Do not learn the framework generally, instead find an example of an application you would like to build from scratch. It will allow you to make mistakes, learn from them, and have an actual project to add to your portfolio. Building such apps from scratch helps you acquire critical skills and experiences. These attributes can help in the creation of more powerful applications.

### Getting a job as a Flutter developer
#### Job description example 
Here is an example of a detailed job description for a Flutter Developer.

#### Flutter developer interview questions
Technical questions a Flutter developer gets during an interview are mostly categorised into two:
1. **Written Questions.**
They mostly test your knowledge on `Dart Programming Language`. Its data structures, algorithms, control flows, and general knowledge in the programming language.

2. **Verbal Questions.**
These questions will test your knowledge on the Flutter framework. They may also include questions on the Dart programming language.
