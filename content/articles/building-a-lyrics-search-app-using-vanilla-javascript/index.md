## Building a Lyrics Search App Using Vanilla JavaScript

![hero image](/engineering-education/building-lyrics-search-app-using-vanilla-javascript/hero.png)

Not knowing the lyrics of a song, is a problem most song-lovers encounter. In this article, you will be creating a platform where users can search for lyrics by entering the artist name or title of the song.

You will be creating the search app using HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript, async-await with fetch method, OVH API, and ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) features like arrow functions.

### Pre-requisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you need the following:

- A code editor (like Visual Studio Code).
- Basic knowledge of HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.
- A laptop with an internet connection.

### Structuring the lyrics search app with HTML5
To begin, create a folder named `lyrics-app`, then you need to create three files in the folder: `lyrics.html`, `lyrics.css`, and `lyrics.js`.

The code snippet below creates the structure for the lyrics search app. In creating the structure of the lyrics search app, you will make use of HTML5. This section deals
with the `lyrics.html` file you created. 

In the head tag (<head></head>) of the HTML file, you will input the needed or pre-defined meta tags that is essential for all web apps. Still in the `head` tag, you would link the CSS file to the HTML file and also give the web app a title of `Lyrics Search App` embedded between the opening and closing `title` tag.

Next, you would create a div with a class of `container`, this is the div that would house other divs which you will create. Moving forward, you will create another div with class of `intro-text`, in this div you will create two separate text using the `h1` and `h2` tag respectively. The content of the first text is `Learn your favourite`, it will be embedded in the `h1` tag, while the content of the second text is `song lyrics`, it will also be embedded in the `h2` tag. Those are the contents for the div that has the class of `intro-text`.

Inside the div with class of `container`, you will create another div with id of `lyrics-search`. In this newly created div, you will create a form which an input field will be embedded in it, and also another separate div where the fetched lyrics would be displayed. 

This is the code snippet for the structure of the web app:

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="lyrics.css"/>
    <title>Lyrics Search App</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="intro-text">
            <h1>Learn your favourite</h1>
            <h2>song lyrics</h2>
        </div>

        <div id="lyrics-search">
            <form action="" id="searchMe">
                <input type="text" id="lyricSearch" placeholder="artist name or song title"/>
            </form>
            <div id="search-result">
                
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <script src="lyrics.js">
        
    </script>
</body>
</html>

```

### Designing the lyrics search app
The next step is to design the web app with CSS by navigating to your CSS file. Here’s the CSS for the structure (HTML code) of the web app:

First, style the overall HTML, body of the HTML, and the div with the class `container` which embodies all other divs.

```css
html {
    box-sizing:border-box;
}

/**Use pseudo elements to set some static styles**/
*,
*:before,
*:after {
      margin:0;
      Padding:0;
}

body {
      background:#333333;
}

.container {
    margin:0 auto;
}

```

Now, you are going to style the contents in the body tag, starting from the text that defines what the web app does, to the placeholder and then the input field.

```css

/**This is how placeholders are styled**/
::placeholder {
        color:gold;
}

```

Next, style up the page description text (Learn your favorite song lyrics).

```css

/**Styling the intro text div which has the content of “learn your favorite song” lyrics**/

.intro-text {
      font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;/**If the device doesn’t have any of the first three font-family sans-serif will automatically be used **/
      padding:2rem 0;
     Color:gold;
}

/**Styling the h1 header(learn your favourite):centering the h1 element**/
h1 {
      text-align:center;
      padding:1rem 0;
}

/**Styling the h1 header(learn your favourite):centering the h1 element**/
h2 {
      text-align:center;
      padding:1rem 0;
}
 /**You might decide to use the comma-separated form of styling tags with the same properties. I decided to be more explicit here for the sake of clarity**/
```

Centering the div container where the form and input field are embedded, using its id (lyrics-search).

```css
#lyrics-search {
    text-align:center;
    align-items:center;
    margin:20px;
    padding:20px;
}

```

You will complete the css code for now by styling up the form and the input field.

```css
form {
    margin:0 auto;
    padding-left:10rem;
}

/**style the input field using its id(lyricSearch)**/

#lyricSearch {
        background-color: transparent;
        color:#eeeeee;
        outline:none;
        height:30px;
        width:64%;
        margin:0 auto;
        padding-right:2rem;
        font-size:16px;
        font-family:cursive;
        outline-style:none;
        border-top:none;
        border-left:none;
        border-right:none;
        border-bottom:1px solid #eeeeee;
}
```

You have successfully designed the web page by adding colors, font-sizes, font-family, padding, margin, and so on just to make this web app look nice.

Here is what your web page should look like:

### Brief Introduction Of OVH API
  The OVH lyrics API, is a simple API that helps us retrieve lyrics of the song requested. While trying to get lyrics from this API, I noticed that it only has two parameters you can use to get data (lyrics), which are the artist name and title of the song. This basically means you can retrieve lyrics by using either the artist name or the title of the song. When a request is made, the data is returned in a JSON format.

Using this API, you will get two status codes. They are:
- Status code 200
- Status code 404

You should be familiar with status code 404, if you don't know, 404 stands for error. According to the usage of this API, code 200 simply means `Here the lyrics of the song` just as we have resolve and reject when will make use of `Promises` in JavaScript, so code 200 can be likened to resolve and code 404 which means `No lyrics found` can be likened to reject.

This is how the url looks like: `https://api.lyrics.ovh/v1/artist/title`

### Adding functionality with JavaScript

In your `lyrics.js` file, declare variables and use the DOM selectors to connect with elements in the `lyrics.html` file, using the code snippet below:

```JavaScript

//you comment in js using double slash, with vscode just highlight what you want to comment and then press "ctrl + /"
//defining variables
const form = document.getElementById("searchMe");//target the form tag in the html file
const search = document.getElementById("lyricSearch");//target th input field
const output = document.getElementById("search-result");//target the output div

```

The desired API to get data (lyrics) for this web app to be fully functional, is the 
[OVH API](https://api.lyrics.ovh).

Declare the API URL using the code below:

```JavaScript

const api = "https://api.lyrics.ovh";

```

The next phase is to submit the form. You will define what would happen if the input field is empty and likewise what would happen if the input field is not empty.

To do this, let’s create an event listener using DOM events to listen for a submit event and not click event because you didn’t create a button to submit the form.

Here is the code snippet for this:

```JavaScript
// Get Search Value
form.addEventListener("submit", e => {
    e.preventDefault();
    searchValue = search.value.trim();

    if (!searchValue) {
        alert("Nothing to search");
    } else {
        startSearch(searchValue);
    }
})

```

In the code above, you listened for a submit event after which you declared a variable `searchValue` to be equal to `search.value.trim()`, the `trim()` method simply trims whitespaces. The if statement validates if `searchValue` equals an empty string, alert "Nothing to search", otherwise, invoke the `startSearch()` function taking the `searchValue` as the argument.

I’d recommend that you explore the [OVH API doc](https://api.lyrics.ovh) before proceeding. You’re about to fetch data (lyrics) from the OVH API.

Now, you can use Async await with the fetch method to get data from the OVH lyrics API.

Using the promise-based fetch API, you will create an async function `startSearch()`.

Here is the code snippet to fetch the data:

```JavaScript
async function startSearch(searchValue) {
    const searchResult = await fetch(`${api}/suggest/${searchValue}`);
    const data = await searchResult.json();
    console.log(data);
    showData(data);
}
```

### Testing the Current State Of the Web app
 At this point, you are going to test if the web app is actually returning the object of data from the OVH API when you input the title of a song or the name of an artist in the search field. The following are the tasks to carry out in this section.
 - Comment out the showData function in the code snippet above (remember to uncomment the showData function).
 - Launch the web app using the [live server vs code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
 - Type in a song in the search field (note that some suggested song lyrics are not avilable on this API, you can get a paid API to explore more).
 - Console log the result (To access the console, right-click inside the webpage, click the inspect option then navigate to the console in the chrome dev tools).

Your screen should be like the screenshot below:

![Screenshot for consoled data](/engineering-education/building-lyrics-search-app-using-vanilla-javascript/console-screenshot.png)

The next thing to do is to create a function `showData()` that will display the data in the console (the screenshot above) on the webpage. The function `showData()` is being called from the async function `startSearch()`.

This is the code snippet for the `showData()` function:

```JavaScript

// Display Search Result
function showData(data) {
    output.innerHTML = `
    <ul class="lyrics">
      ${data.data
        .map(song=> `<li>
                    <div>
                        <strong>${song.artist.name}</strong> -${song.title} 
                    </div>
                    <span class="btn" data-artist="${song.artist.name}" data-songtitle="${song.title}">Get Lyrics</span>
                </li>`
        )
        .join('')}
    </ul>
  `;
}
```

In the code snippet above, a `showData()` function was created and data was passed as an argument. The name of the function is very descriptive, it is to display the lyrics on the webpage. The question that comes to mind is where you want to display the lyrics. The lyrics will be displayed inside an empty div in the `lyrics.html` file, the variable that connects the div to the JavaScript file is the variable output.

### Inner - HTML
This is the DOM property that either sets or retrieves the content of an HTML element.In this instance, you will set the content of the empty div in the `lyrics.html` file to display the lyrics suggestions in a list form.

In other to access the data, refer to the screenshot above, you will notice that the data embodies some set of objects which has the properties we want to display on the webpage.

Also, from the screenshot above, the object inside the data has a key of `title` that returns a property of the song title, likewise an artist object that embodies a key of `name` that returns a property of the song artist. Our concern is how to display the song title and song artist name on the webpage.

The `map()` method is one of the most used methods. The method returns a new array based on the values of the existing array. For example, we have array of numbers and we want to get an array that has value of triple of each of the number:

```JavaScript
const numbers = [2 , 4, 6, 8];
const tripleNo = numbers.map(tripleNum);
function tripleNum(number) {
   return number * 3;
}
console.log(tripleNo);//[6,12,18,24] this should be displayed in your console.
```

Normally, to access the song title and song artist name, you would have invoked `data.data.title` for song title and `data.data.artist.name` for the song artist name. If you recall, the argument - song represents the resulting data. 

Since the data has been mapped, you will access the song title using `song.title` as well as the song artist name by using `song.artist.name`.

The following code helps us listen to click event inside the output InnerHTML:

```JavaScript
//event listener in get lyrics button
output.addEventListener('click', e=>{
    const clickedElement = e.target;

    //checking clicked element is button or not
    if (clickedElement.tagName === 'SPAN'){
        const artist = clickedElement.getAttribute('data-artist');
        const songTitle = clickedElement.getAttribute('data-songtitle');
        
        getLyrics(artist, songTitle);
    }
})

```

The code above helps to know if the clicked element is the span tag. If it is, (i.e the span tag is === variable clickedElement), the statement in the if block is executed because the span tag bears the tagname `SPAN`. You will store the attribute `data-songtitle` in variable `songTiltle` as well as the attribute `data-artist` for song artist in variable `artist`, which the `getLyrics()` function takes in the two variables as parameters.

Note, arguments are the actual values passed to a function, while parameters are the values passed when a function is defined. Arguments are values passed when a function is invoked. That's why I referred the two variables passed into the `getLyrics()` function as parameters and not arguments.

### GetLyrics() async function
This is the most important function because this is what makes us get the lyrics themselves displayed. The function takes in two parameters, artist and songTitle respectively, recall that you can search for lyrics through inputting song artist or song title. This is the reason why the `getLyrics()` function is taking those parameters.

Below is the code for `getLyrics()` async function:

```JavaScript
async function getLyrics(artist, songTitle) {
    const response = await fetch(`${api}/v1/${artist}/${songTitle}`);
    const data = await response.json();
  
    const lyrics = data.lyrics;
    if (lyrics === undefined){
        alert('lyrics doesnt exist in this api');
        console.log('lyrics doesnt exist in this api');
    }
  
    output.innerHTML = `<h2><strong>${artist}</strong> - ${songTitle}</h2>
    <p id="lyrics-display">${lyrics}</p>`;
  
  }
```

Note, the API doesn't have all the lyrics of songs it suggests, it's still in progress. If you wish to have an app that can return so many lyrics, I would suggest you get a paid lyrics API. If a particular lyrics is not avialable, it will return undefined in the div to display lyrics, it also alerts you that the lyrics is not available on the API. Also, when you input a song title to search for, you have to exercise little patience for the data to load because it is a bit slow.

Next, you can decide to implement Regular Expression(REGEX) syntax in the variable lyrics using the `replace` method, by adding `.replace(/(\r\n|\r|\n)/g ,'<br>');` to the lyrics variable, meaning you should have something like this,
`const lyrics = data.lyrics.replace(/(\r\n|\r|\n)/g ,'<br>');`. This will return well-aligned lyrics displayed on the webpage.

REGEX usage in this article, help to look through our data (lyrics) for:
- Carriage return alone.
- Carriage return with a new line. 

If any of the instances defined above is found, REGEX `replace` method replaces it with the <br> (break line). 

The `/g` is a regular expression flag, it means globally, the entire data (lyrics) should be searched through (for all matches).

The content of the variable output displays song titles in bolder form compared to the artist name because of the strong tag.

Finally, the lyrics are displayed in the paragraph tag when the span tag is clicked.

### Styling and centering the lyrics
Navigate to your css file and add the code below to style and center the lyrics:

```css

.lyrics {
    width: 70%;
    list-style: none;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 2rem 0;
}

.lyrics li {
    font-size: 1.4rem;
    text-align: center;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    padding: 5px 0;
    border-bottom: 1px solid  gold;
}

.lyrics li span {
    font-size: 1.4rem;
    padding: 5px;
    margin: 5px;
    cursor: pointer;
}

.lyrics li span:hover {
    background-color: lightyellow;
}

/*styling the button to get the lyrics*/
.btn {
    padding: 4px;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    text-align: center;
    outline: none;
    border-radius: 3px;
    text-decoration: none;
    font-size: 1.2rem;
    cursor: pointer;
    background-color: gold;
    color: white;
}

```

The entire JavaScript code :
    In other for you not to run into errors while fetching data from the API, I will suggest you rearrange your code like the code snippet below. What you are basically doing, is creating a function above before it's been called, so you don't run into errors (JavaScript is very sensitive to things like this).

```JavaScript

//defining the variables
const form = document.getElementById("searchMe");//target the form tag in the html file
const search = document.getElementById("lyricSearch");//target th input field
const output = document.getElementById("search-result");

const api = "https://api.lyrics.ovh";


//structuring how the result will be displayed using the suggestion mode the API supports
function showData(data) {
    output.innerHTML = `
    <ul class="lyrics">
      ${data.data
        .map(song=> `<li>
                    <div>
                        <strong>${song.artist.name}</strong> -${song.title} 
                    </div>
                    <span class="btn" data-artist="${song.artist.name}" data-songtitle="${song.title}">Get Lyrics</span>
                </li>`
        )
        .join('')}
    </ul>
  `;
}

//declaring async function to fetch data from api

async function startSearch(searchValue) {
    const searchResult = await fetch(`${api}/suggest/${searchValue}`);
    const data = await searchResult.json();

    showData(data);
}

//calling the function that gets and displays the lyrics

async function getLyrics(artist, songTitle) {
    const response = await fetch(`${api}/v1/${artist}/${songTitle}`);
    const data = await response.json();
  
    const lyrics = data.lyrics;
    if (lyrics === undefined){
        alert('lyrics doesnt exist in this api');
        console.log('lyrics doesnt exist in this api');
    }
  
    output.innerHTML = `<h2><strong>${artist}</strong> - ${songTitle}</h2>
    <p id="lyrics-display">${lyrics}</p>`;
  
}

//listening if the clicked event is on the span tag, so lyrics can be called and displayed
output.addEventListener('click', e=>{
    const clickedElement = e.target;

    //checking clicked element is button or not
    if (clickedElement.tagName === 'SPAN'){
        const artist = clickedElement.getAttribute('data-artist');
        const songTitle = clickedElement.getAttribute('data-songtitle');
        
        getLyrics(artist, songTitle)
    }
})


//listening for a submit event
form.addEventListener("submit", e => {
    e.preventDefault();
    searchValue = search.value.trim();

    if (!searchValue) {
        alert("Nothing to search");
    } else {
        startSearch(searchValue);
    }
})

```

### Conclusion
In this tutorial, you built a lyrics search web app using HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript alongside ES6 features.

I’m a big fan of you not just stopping at what is provided in this tutorial. If indeed you’ve learnt something from this, I challenge you to add more features to this web app and also make the User Interface (UI) better. You can add a button that copies the lyrics to the clipboard or a button that helps you share lyrics with friends via social media platforms.

The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/shegz101/Lyrics-Web-App).
