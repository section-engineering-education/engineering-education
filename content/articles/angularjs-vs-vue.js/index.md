Angular.js and Vue.js are both JavaScript based frameworks popularly used in frontâ€“end web development. They have a variety of features and functions tailored to meet different needs.
<!--more-->
### Goal
This article will discuss Angular.js and Vue.js, their differences, key features, and use cases.

### An Overview of Angular.js
[Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) is an open-source Javascript framework that Google introduced in [2012](http://blog.angularjs.org/2012/07/). It is a TypeScript-based framework developed for custom web applications.

Angular.js decreases the need for boilerplate code when developing an application. It is highly recommended for single-page applications. Angular.js offers developers adequate resources for creating user-friendly applications.

Since Google manages it, Angular.js offers a flexible infrastructure that can sustain large applications. It provides features that enable decoupling of any logic from the Document Object Model ([DOM](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/dom-manipulation)) manipulation. 

Angular.js also accommodates HTML extensions. Applications developed in Angular.js facilitate cross-browsing. Best of all, Angular.js is free.

### An Overview of Vue.js
[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is popularly known as a progressive framework. It was introduced in the year [2014](https://vuejs.org/2014/03/22/vuejs-010-release/). Vue.js is used to build user interfaces. Unlike other frameworks, it is designed to be highly interactive and adaptable. Its library is easily integrable with other projects making it very efficient.

When combined with supporting libraries and mobile tooling, Vue.js can help build highly advanced single-page applications. It also uses a modular approach in web development and focuses on the `view` layer.

### Key Features of Angular.js
Angular.js is a reliable and user-friendly framework. 

Below are some of its key features:
- HTML UI - Angular.js uses the HTML language, which is declarative and easily understandable. Its interface is well structured, allowing designers to implement different UI elements easily. With such an interface, designers and developers can collaborate well.

- MVC architecture - This is a software concept used in software development. MVC architecture is the most known strategy used for organizing web applications. MVC is composed of three components. These elements are the Model, the View, and the Controller part. 

Below are the functions of each component:
- *Model* - It defines class variables and data types such as Booleans and strings.
- *View* - This is where the information is presented to the user.
- *Controller* - This is where the interaction between the view and model takes place. 
- *POJO model* - [POJO](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/pojo) stands for `Plain Old JavaScript Objects`. The POJO model provides organized logic and objects. With POJO, it is easier for developers to code since they do not have to keep on checking the app's data flow.

### Key Features of Vue.js
Some of the features of Vue.js include:
- *Data binding* - This feature facilitates the manipulation of the HTML interface. With the help of the `v-bind` directive, changing the style is possible.
- *Transitions* - Vue.js provides various methods to have transitions applied when a UI element is inserted or removed from the DOM.
- *Computed properties* - In this feature, no added code is needed. It responds to the changes made on the user interface and then works out the calculations. A computed property is used for any logic that requires multiple expressions.
- *Components* - Components are very important features of Vue.js. They facilitate the extension of HTML elements to provide reusable widgets.
- *Custom directives* - These features provide a structure for surveying data changes for unpredictable DOM behavior.

### Differences between Angular.js and Vue.js
In as much as Angular.js and Vue.js are both JavaScript-based frameworks, they have several differences. Some key differences between them are as discussed below.

#### Performance metrics
Vue.js has higher performance metrics than Angular.js due to the DOM concept. In Angular.js, the change detection system enables a reduction in the DOM manipulation. The app and HTML components can be recompiled even before they are downloaded or used by the browser. 

This framework can, however, influence the application negatively, thus limiting its success. The DOM concept in Vue.js offers more reliable ways to change the interface. It provides a reduced running and loading time, resulting in higher performance when compared to Angular.js.

#### Integration with backend technologies
Angular.js is good for developing inbuilt functionalities. It offers flexibility and scalable infrastructure. Besides, it provides a back end that aligns with client and server sides. It can thus, be combined with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and JavaScript.

On the other hand, Vue.js aims at developing a complex and efficient user interface. With Vue.js, a backend framework with understandable code is required. For instance, a combination of [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and Vue.js is appropriate since they are both detailed and well-structured.

#### State management
[NgRx](https://ngrx.io/https://ngrx.io/) offers state management for Angular.js applications. NgRx is a group of libraries. With this state management library, it is possible to speed up the application's response to user interactions.

Vue.js has fewer framework-based libraries when compared to Angular.js. `VUEx` manages state in large Vue.js applications. The library stays in check with the reactive data, acts as a database, then pushes the data to different widgets without tampering with its performance.

#### Simplicity
Vue.js is easier to understand than Angular.js due to its simple syntax. Angular.js uses a more complex syntax.

#### Compatibility with templates
Projects developed using Angular.js cannot facilitate backward compatibility while those with Vue.js support it. With Angular.js, templates are used to keep up with the user's interaction. It, therefore, presents data in an appealing way. 

Vue.js uses templates based on HTML. Small components are bound from the rendered DOM. This enables templates to be compiled; hence the DOM manipulation is achieved in the most minimal form.

### Use cases of Angular.js and Vue.js
Both angular and Vue.js have highly contributed to web development. The following real-life use cases depict a clearer picture of how they are both applied.

#### Use cases of Angular.js
- Udacity - [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) is an e-learning platform that provides students with professional courses. It helps in the programming, machine language, and artificial intelligence niche. Angular.js's front end is used to build educational platforms. Angular.js enables this platform to facilitate many uses without failing. This is possible due to Angular.js's ability to scale.

- YouTube - This is a top internet - television service that is widely used all over the world. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/about/) is known for its digital video recording (DVR) service, which supports unlimited streaming. The framework has managed to create a quality user interface. It also accommodates many users.

- Mixer - This platform allowed users to live stream video games. It was known for its engaging video game streaming service. The low latency for live streaming and Angular.js enabled the platform to be highly interactive and responsive. However, it has been discontinued.

#### Use cases of Vue.js
- Alibaba - [Alibaba](https://activities.alibaba.com/alibaba/following-about-alibaba.php?) is an e-commerce platform that is globally used. Vue.js is more reliable for its efficiency and high interaction between the user module and product module. Vue.js is highly convenient in terms of scale, response and flexibility. The framework facilities the changing of arrays similar to state changes. This prevents unwanted DOM manipulation.

- Laracasts - [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/) is an online platform to learn programming languages. The user interface (UI) is developed using Vue.js. This platform accommodates thousands of students. Furthermore, the application is user-friendly and interactive.

- Grammarly - This is a web application that helps users in editing or correcting errors in their documents. The website's load time is fast, and proofreading is very effective. [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/about) has a reliable user experience. The user interface is developed using Vue.js, but it is powered by artificial intelligence.

- Laravel website - This site uses Vue.js to accomplish a very elegant and well-planned code architecture. User experience standards are highly maintained, and the application accommodates many users.

### Conclusion
Vue.js and Angular.js frameworks are growing rapidly. Both frameworks are highly responsive and interactive. They both have unique features that are tailored to meet different needs. When choosing a framework, ensure you look out for future growth and development possibilities.

Happy coding.
