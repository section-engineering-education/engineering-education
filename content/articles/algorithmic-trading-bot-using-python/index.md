### What is a trading bot?
A trading bot is simply a software that automates the trading process. It uses past data to give out expected outcomes.

### Prerequisites
The main prerequisite for this tutorial is basic knowledge of python and its algorithms. For testing, we will use **QUANTCONNECT** which uses the lean engine to integrate your code with the trading site. That means that you don't require an offline editor since the site provides its own development environment.

### Coding and development
With your requirements ready, you can now code along for a practical understanding.

Go to [www.quantconnect.com](www.quantconnect.com) and sign up to set up your coding environment. You can also use an offline editor and upload the code later for testing.

Let's get started!

We will develop the bot by following the steps below:

### Step 1: Create a new algorithm
From the options on the left side of the page, click on `Create new Algorithm`. You will be directed to the editor with a class generated automatically.

Below is the class generated:

```python
class GeekyBlueSeahorse(QCAlgorithm):
    def Initialize(self):
    def OnData(self, data):
```

### Step 2: Import required libraries
In this case, we will only require one library i.e. _NumPy_.

Import at the top as follows:

```python
import NumPy as np
```

### Step 3. Initialize required variables
Under the initialize method, we will initialize several parameters:
- Initialize cash for the purpose of the backtest (we call it the strategy cash) which would be used on a real account.
- Set the start and end date for the backtest.

The code is as follows:

```python
        self.SetStartDate(2015, 3, 26)  # Set Start Date
        self.SetEndDate(2021, 9, 25) # Set End Date
        self.SetCash(100000)  # Set Strategy Cash

```

Still under the initialize method, we will:
- Use `AddEquity` function to monitor the resolution of the intended data.
- Initialize the amount of days we will look back to determine our break point.
- Set limits for the lookback i.e. a lower and an upper limit

In this case, we will use a daily resolution:

```python
    self.symbol = self.AddEquity("SPY", Resolution.Daily).Symbol
    self.lookback = 20
    self.ceiling, self.floor = 30, 10

```

The last thing to initialize is the stop loss extent:

```python
    self.initialStopRisk = 0.98
    self.trailingStopRisk = 0.9
```

The first variable determines how close our stop loss will be to the security price. Meaning that it will allow a 2% loss before it gets hit.

The second variable indicates how close our trading stop will follow the assets' price. This means that it will trail the price for 10% which is quite big but gives more room for price flexibility.

#### Step 4: Define a method to plot the data
We will define the `onData` method to create a plot of the price of the securities. This gives a benchmark to compare our algorithm performance:

```python
def OnData(self, data):
       self.Plot("Data Chart", self.symbol, self.Securities[self.symbol].Close)

```

This will also determine the closing price.

#### Step 5:Create the trading method
The next step will be to create the method that will do all the trading for us. It will be called after a market opens. We will call it `"EveryMarketOpen"` for simplicity.

```python
def EveryMarketOpen(self):

```

After this, we will have to initialize one more function in the _initialize_ method. This the `Schedule.On` function which takes three parameters:
- The first specifies on which day the method is called.
- The second specifies at which time the method is called
- The last specifies which method is called, in this case it is `EveryMarketOpen` method.

Add the following code to the initialize method:

```python
self.Schedule.On(self.DateRules.EveryDay(self.symbol), \
                self.TimeRules.AfterMarketOpen(self.symbol, 20), \
                Action(self.EveryMarketOpen))
```

#### Step 6: Implement the EveryMarketOpen method
First, we will determine the lookback length for our breakout. Within a utility of 60 days, we will compare the current value today with the same value yesterday. This will help determine the length of the lookback window.

Call the History function to get data for the last 61 days or your preferred number of days. This is where we use the NumPy library to calculate the standard deviation for the two days. We will list all the highest and lowest prices within a specified range, for this case, 60days

The following code falls under this `EveryMarketOpen` method to perform all the comparisons required to give a result:

```python
    def EveryMarketOpen(self):
        close = self.History(self.Symbol, 61, Resolution.Monthly)["close"]
        todayvol = np.std(close[1:61])
        yesterdayvol = np.std(close[0:60]) // standard deviation
        initialvol = (currentvol - yestervol) / (currentvol)

        self.lookback = round(self.lookback * (1 + initialvol))

        if self.lookback > self.highest:
            self.lookback = self.highest
        elif
          self.lookback < self.lowest:
            self.lookback = self.lowest
        self.high = self.History(self.Symbol, self.lookback, Resolution.Minute)["high"]

        if not self.Securities(self.Symbol).Invested and \
                self.Securities(self.Symbol).Close >= max(self.high[:-1]):

                self.SetHoldings(self.Symbol, 1)
                self.breakoutlevel = max(selt.high[:-1])
                self.highestPrice = self.breakoutlevel

        if self.Securities(self.Symbol).Invested:

            if not self.Transactions.GetOpenOrders(self.symbol):
                self.endMarketTicket = self.endMarketOrder(self.symbol, \
                                        -self.Portfolio[self.symbol].Quantity, \
                                        self.initialStopRisk * self.breakoutlevel)


            if not self.Securities(self.Symbol).Close > self.highestPrice and \
                    self.initialStopRisk * self.breakoutlevel < self.Securities[self.symbol].Close * self.trailingStopRisk:

                    self.highestPrice = self.Securities[self.symbol].Close
                    updateFields = UpdateOrderFields()
                    updateFields.stopPrice = self.Securities[self.Symbol] * self.trailingStopRisk
                    self.endMarketTicket.Update(updateFields)

```

#### Step 7: Plotting the stop price
Lastly, print the new stock price to the console, to check the new order price every time they get updated. We cannot use the normal `print` function, instead, use the `self.Debug` function which is quant equivalent to print.

Finalize by plotting the stop price of our position onto the data chart we created earlier. This allows us to view where our stop price is compared to the securities trading price.

```python
self.Debug(updateFields.stopPrice)
        self.Plot("Data Chart", "Stop Price", self.stopMarketTicket.Get(OrderField.StopPrice))
```

Below is how the complete code looks like:

```python
import numpy as np
class GeekyBlueSeahorse(QCAlgorithm):
    def Initialize(self):
        self.SetStartDate(2015, 3, 26)  # Set Start Date
        self.SetEndDate(2021, 9, 25)
        self.SetCash(100000)  # Set Strategy Cash
        self.symbol = self.AddEquity("SPY", Resolution.Daily).Symbol
        self.lookback = 20
        self.ceiling, self.floor = 30, 10
        self.initialStopRisk = 0.98
        self.trailingStopRisk = 0.9

        self.Schedule.On(self.DateRules.EveryDay(self.symbol), \
                         self.TimeRules.AfterMarketOpen(self.symbol, 20), \
                          Action(self.EveryMarketOpen))
    def OnData(self, data):
        self.Plot("Data Chart", self.symbol, self.Securities[self.symbol].Close)

 def EveryMarketOpen(self):
        close = self.History(self.Symbol, 61, Resolution.Monthly)["close"]
        todayvol = np.std(close[1:61])
        yesterdayvol = np.std(close[0:60]) // standard deviation
        initialvol = (currentvol - yestervol) / (currentvol)

        self.lookback = round(self.lookback * (1 + initialvol))

        if self.lookback > self.highest:
            self.lookback = self.highest
        elif
          self.lookback < self.lowest:
            self.lookback = self.lowest
        self.high = self.History(self.Symbol, self.lookback, Resolution.Minute)["high"]

        if not self.Securities(self.Symbol).Invested and \
                self.Securities(self.Symbol).Close >= max(self.high[:-1]):
                self.SetHoldings(self.Symbol, 1)
                self.breakoutlevel = max(selt.high[:-1])
                self.highestPrice = self.breakoutlevel
        if self.Securities(self.Symbol).Invested:
            if not self.Transactions.GetOpenOrders(self.symbol):
                self.endMarketTicket = self.endMarketOrder(self.symbol, \
                                        -self.Portfolio[self.symbol].Quantity, \
                                        self.initialStopRisk * self.breakoutlevel)
        if not self.Securities(self.Symbol).Close > self.highestPrice and \
                    self.initialStopRisk * self.breakoutlvl < self.Securities[self.symbol].Close * self.trailingStopRisk:
                    self.highestPrice = self.Securities[self.symbol].Close
                    updateFields = UpdateOrderFields()
                    updateFields.stopPrice = self.Securities[self.Symbol] * self.trailingStopRisk
                    self.endMarketTicket.Update(updateFields)
                    self.Debug(updateFields.stopPrice)
                    self.Plot("Data Chart", "Stop Price", self.endMarketTicket.Get(OrderField.StopPrice))
```

#### Step 8: Performing a backtest
A backtest is performed to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. It integrates the code with your brokerage site to get results as if it was an actual trading practice.

You can see the image below:

### Why algorithmic trading bot
Here are some of the key merits of this algorithmic trading:
1. **Saves on time** since a trader does not need to sit there all day doing the trade. This allows one to work on other things while earning.
2. **Higher accuracy** expected since the bot compares and considers a large volume of data before coming up with a prediction. This is a bonus since a trader cannot go through data of up to or maybe more than a year.
3. **Increased trading time** - Most probably, the bot can trade for 24hours a day without getting tired. This means that if its accuracy is higher enough, then the profits made are higher than human-guided trading.

### Why are people still against algorithmic trading?
Besides giving better results, some people are still against this type of trading. This is the one **Main** reason:

#### Systemic Risk
Sometimes, linkages between financial markets may occur. As a result, algorithms operating under those markets transmit rapid shocks from one market to another thus triggering a systematic risk. These systematic risks bring about **huge losses**, which is considered a great risk.

Due to such risk, people prefer to trade on their own rather than depending on the software.

### Conclusion
With the growing E-economy, e-trading has become one of the biggest contributors. Giving a verdict on whether to use automated software (Trading bot) or not is always a personal decision.

This article sets a journey for those who are interested in developing their algorithm for trading rather than using the ready-made.

I hope you find this tutorial helpful.

Happy coding!
