Business intelligence tools can enable organizations to collect, manipulate, and analyze data to create meaningful insights. With these actionable insights, businesses can make strategic decisions that enable them to grow. 

There is a wide variety of BI tools that organizations can use for business intelligence. Choosing a suitable BI tool can be a daunting task. This article takes you through 10 powerful business intelligence tools data analysts (and organizations can use) to grow their businesses.

### Introduction to business intelligence
Business Intelligence entails using strategies and technologies to conduct data analysis and integration of [business information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_information). It is a concept that encompasses the tools, software, and processes that analyze, collect, and integrate data to generate actionable information. 

Business intelligence combines three main concepts with data analysis: data collection, data storage, and knowledge management. The main essence of business intelligence is to enhance the timeliness and accuracy of business information. This improves decision making in organizations. 

Business intelligence tools refer to the applications, programs, and software used to achieve the objective of business intelligence. These tools provide services such as data warehousing, reporting, data visualization, and dashboard development. 

Companies are also using business intelligence tools to predict future performance. Other functions provided by BI technologies include data mining, benchmarking, business performance management, and prescriptive analytics.

Various sources of data are used to develop a business intelligence system. Some of these sources include customer relationship management systems, marketing analytics, and data from call centers. This data is cleaned, transformed, and aggregated before it is sent to a data warehouse. The data warehouse plays the role of storing data. 

In a BI system, data can be integrated with other data sources using various tools. Some of the tools used include business analytics, data mining, and ETL engines. Business analytics is also used for analyzing the collected data. Business intelligence tools are used to provide enhanced insights. 

These insights help organizations make fast and impactful decisions. Business intelligence results can be presented using [Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)](https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/OLAP) and visualization tools. OLAP is a technique that enables users to analyze, view, or extract data from various points of view. BI results can also be presented on dashboards and scorecards.

- **Operational efficiency:** BI tools enable organizations to gain insights from the analyzed data. Organizations use these insights to streamline processes, which improves operational efficiency in the business.
