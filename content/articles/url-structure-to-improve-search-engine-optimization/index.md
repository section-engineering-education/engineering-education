### URL structuring
URL structuring is the process of designing a URL to meet users' readability and memorization needs. Simply, it is the process of choosing a name for a website that users can easily remember. In this article, you will learn how to organize your URL to improve your site's performance in SEO rankings and make it easier to memorize by your users.

### Reasons to improve your URL structure
- Search Engine Optimization Engineers and Web developers believe in improving their URL structure for better readability by the users. 
- Optimized URL structure positively impacts SEO performance and rankings in Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) even as a site scales.
- Search engines like Google and Bing are concerned with providing their users with highly relevant results. Therefore, search engine companies such as Google must know each website's contents in its index to give relevant search results to its visitors. As a result, Google looks at the URL of a site to identify what the webpage is about.
- It will assist you in obtaining extra backlinks and click-thru-rate from authoritative sites, gradually influencing your SEO position. Backlinks are an important ranking factor to consider. This helps ensure that you are not deterring people from sharing your site's content.
- It makes it easier for users to navigate through your website. For instance, the URL `www.myarticles.com/best-URL-structures` has a good structure since it allows users to know they are on the page `best-URL-structures.`

### Tips for Structuring your next URL
Now that you have a basic understanding of URL structuring and why a good URL structure is important, it is time for the tips on structuring your next URL. Below are a few of the standard practices for structuring a URL.

#### 1. Make the URL relevant to what is on the page
Avoid automatically generated URLs. Most of them look like long strings of magic words, making it harder for users to memorize. 
Irrelevant URLs increase the complexity of Search engine crawlers when they relate what is on the URL with the web page's contents. Thus, customizing the URL improves the page’s Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) and SEO rankings.

#### 2. Keep the URL Simple and Short
A good URL should include two to three keywords that are short and easy to read. Short URLs are easy to remember, while long ones are harder to recall. This negatively affects your site's click-thru rate. Hence, finding a perfect balance between the wording and the number of keywords you use is essential for boosting SEO ranking. 

A short and straightforward URL would look like  `www.myexample.com/firstpage/your-examples` while a long and hard-to-remember URL may look like `www.myexample.com/categories/first-folder/first10page/195943/wretsfghv.`

#### 3. Use Primary Key Words
Each page on your website should have a primary keyword. The keywords should also be similar to the title or topic of the page. This improves the search engine's ability to identify the type of content on your page. 

For example, you may include a page with details about your company on your website. Hence, you may want to structure the company’s URL to look a bit like `www.yourcompanywebsite.com/about-us.` This will help search engines and users quickly pre-determine what is on the page before they dive into it.

#### 4. Remove Stop Words and Special Characters
Remember we said we want our URLs to be short and straightforward for easy readability. This means you will have to avoid words like pronouns and articles. When designing a URL structure, you should avoid using common stop words such as `a, the, and, or, but.` 
It is also best to avoid special characters like `#, %, !` in your URL since they are not common, and users might fail to notice them.

> A stop word is a phrase used in natural language processing when categorizing words common in a language but carries little information. 

#### 5. Use Hyphens to Separate Words
In the URL `ww.yourwebsite.com/about-us` after the forward-slash, the `about-us` phrase tells users the page is about your website or company. 
It is good to separate URLs with hyphens since they do not allow spaces. That way, search engines, and users can easily separate the words when reading the URL and relate with what is on the page.

#### 6. Avoid Uppercase Letters
It is standard practice to stick to lowercase letters when structuring your URLs. Any word that follows your URL's domain name is case-sensitive. A URL such as `www.myexample.com/examples` and `www.myexample.com/Exaples` will produce different results since the words `example` and `Example` are treated as distinct pages on your site. 

#### 7. Use HTTPS
Your website's credibility and trustworthiness are crucial factors in influencing user experience. Thus,  including the HTTPS protocol into your URL and confirming that your domain name is a Top-Level Domain (TLD) will instill trust in your site's visitors, consequently boosting SEO rankings.

### Conclusion
Creating a proper URL structure to improve Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) and SEO rankings demands a thorough preparation. Thus understanding good URL structuring guides consequently betters your site's visibility to search engines and users. 
I hope this post has helped you realize the necessity of a good URL structure and how to improve it to better your site's visibility.
