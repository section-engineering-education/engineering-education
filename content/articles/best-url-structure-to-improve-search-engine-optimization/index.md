- Optimized URL structure positively impacts SEO performance and rankings in Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) even as a site scales.
- Search engines like Google and Bing are concerned with providing their users with highly relevant results. Therefore, search engine companies such as Google must know each website's contents in its index in order for them to give relevant search results to its visitors. As a result, Google looks at the URL of a site to identify what the webpage is about.

- It makes it easier for users to navigate through your website. For instance, the URL `www.myarticles.com/best-URL-structures` has a good structure since it allows users know they are on the page `best-URL-structures.`

#### Tips for Structuring your Next URL
Now that you have basic knowledge of URL structuring and why a good URL structure is important, it is time for the tips on how to structure your next URL. Below are a few of the standard practices for structuring a URL.

#### 1. Make The URL Relevant to What Is On The Page
Avoid automatically generated URLs. Most of them look like long strings of magic words, making it harder for users to memorize. 
Irrelevant URLs increase the complexity of Search engine crawlers when they are relating what is on the URL with the web page's contents. Thus, customizing the URL improves the page’s Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) and SEO rankings.

#### 2. Keep the URL Simple and Short
A good URL should include two to three keywords that are short and easy to read. Short URLs are easy to remember while long ones are harder to recal. This negatively affects your sites click-thru-rate. Hence, finding a perfect balance between the wording and number of keywords you use is essential for boosting SEO ranking. 

A short and simple URL would look like  `www.myexample.com/firstpage/your-examples` while a long and hard to rember URL may look like `www.myexample.com/categories/first-folder/first10page/195943/wretsfghv`

#### 3. Use Primary Key Words
Each page on your website should have a primary keyword. The keywords should also be similar to the title or topic of the page. This improves the search engines' ability to identify the type of content on your page. 

For example, you may include a page with details about your company on your website. Hence, you may want to structure the company’s URL to look a bit like `www.yourcompanywebsite.com/about-us.` This will help search engines and users quickly pre-determine what is on the page before they dive into it.

#### 4. Remove Stop Sords and Special Characters
Remember we said we want our URLs to be simple and short for easy readability. This means you will have to avoid words like pronouns and articles. When designing a URL structure, you should avoid using common stop words such as `a, the, and, or, but.` 
It is also best to avoid special characters like `#, %, !` in your URL since they are not common, and users might fail to notice them.

> A stop word is a phrase used in Natural language processing when categorizing words that are common in a language but carry little information. 

#### 5. Use Hyphens to Separate Words
In the URL `ww.yourwebsite.com/about-us` after the forward-slash, the `about-us` phrase tells users the page is about your website or company. 
It is good to separate URLs with hyphens since they do not allow spaces. That way, search engines and users can easily separate the words when reading the URL and relate with what is on the page.

#### 6. Avoid Uppercase Letters
It is starndard practice for you to stick to lowercase letters when structuring your URLs. Any word that follows your URL's domain name is case sensitive. A url such as `www.myexample.com/examples` and `www.myexample.com/Exaples` will produce different results since the words `example` and `Example` are treated as distict pages on your site. 

#### 7. Use HTTPS
Your website's credibility and trustworthiness are crucial factors in influencing user experience. Thusd,  including the HTTPS protocol into your URL and confirming that your domain name is a Top-Level Domain (TLD) will instill trust in your site's visitors consequencly boosting SEO rankings.


#### Conclusion
Creating a proper URL structure to improve Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) and SEO rankings demands a thorough preparation. Thus understanding good URL structuring guides consequently betters your site's visibility to search engines and users. 
I hope this post has helped you realize the necessity of a good URL structure and how to improve it to better your site's visibility.
