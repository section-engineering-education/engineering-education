The 21st century has seen unprecedented growth in software development. People are embracing current trends such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and virtual reality more and more. The impact of this is being felt in our day-to-day activities.

IoT solutions bring in many advantages to businesses and individuals alike. Such benefits include improved operations, work safety, and cost-effectiveness. However, realizing these benefits requires starting with the correct programming language for IoT devices.

This article discusses the development of IoT solutions with both [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and C++. It also compares the two to help you chose the correct programming language for developing IoT applications and devices.

### IoT development with C++
C++ is one of the most preferred languages for developing IoT applications and devices. As an extension of the C language, C++ boasts embedded programming and low-level project capabilities, which are essential for developing IoT devices.

C++ is a middle-level language whose object-oriented programing capability is best for low-level memory management. In addition, the language is designed for constrained devices and extensive systems.

Software built-in C++ experiences the benefits of speed, efficiency, and performance.

Some of the real-life applications of C++ are medical applications, games, operating systems, and database software.

Processors have become more powerful while the application landscape keeps on posing additional challenging requirements. Despite this, C++ usage for IoT solutions remains high.

C++ brings greater flexibility and demands less energy consumption since small devices often have limited power capabilities, and C++ is ideal for such environments.

### C++ compared to C
C++ is higher than C considering its additional features such as data abstraction, classes, and objects lacking in C. For this reason, IoT code on Linux systems is better written in C++.

C++ has many similarities to C, and one of those is the processing power that C++ banks on to handle complex tasks. These tasks are not limited to devices serving multiple functions or having multiple sensors.

Most of the IoT devices available today lack enough processing power to run high-level languages. C++ is the programming language solution for such devices. Besides, the support for C++ has been extended to most of the operating systems available for IoT platforms.

### IoT development with Rust
Rust has gained significant popularity in recent years owing to its ability to meet system programming needs.

Segmentation faults (segfault) such as those associated with C++ are limited in Rust. They are a result of thread safety and memory safety issues.

Rust addresses such shortcomings and brings the power of high-level languages to meet the programming needs of low-level systems.

In developing this open-source systems programming language, the Mozilla Foundation had speed, memory safety, and the ability to support concurrency in mind.

While Rust's syntax is similar to C++ and C, it brings additional benefits to functional programming languages such as [Haskel](https://www.haskel.com/en-us). For example, by introducing abstractions like closures and iterators.

The lack of a garbage collector in Rust is essential for memory management. Rust does not allow null pointers and dangling pointers. It favors references over pointers, unlike C++ that relies heavily on pointers.

Rust tracks memory allocation, de-allocation, and access in managing memory safety.

### How Rust compares to C++ in development of IoT solutions
#### Memory safety
Both Rust and C++ have various features that prevent memory corruption and enhance memory stability.

For example, in Rust, bindings on data have a unique owner with either one mutable borrow or all-immutable borrows. This ownership model ensures memory safety in Rust and between threads.

Immutable borrow allows the variable borrowing to read the value but not mutate. This happens regardless of a mutable original value.

In addition, immutable borrowing guarantees the borrowing variable that the value would not change. A compute-time error occurs if a code violates these conditions.

C++ and Rust are type-safe languages, but the implicit conversions between types in C++ weaken its type system. Type safety means using the types correctly to avoid unsafe unions and casts.

#### Accessibility
Rust provides a [foreign function interface](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/std_misc/ffi.html). With such an interface, Rust can make use of services written in other programming languages.

C++ has a [trivial foreign function interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface) with C. The two languages share a common subset. The FFI in C++ provides a simple-to-use mechanism for users to interact with C++ in both [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org/) and [CPython](https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/cpython_differences.html).

Cross compiler tool-chains in Rust support most Linux distributions and other popular operating systems. This means you can create executable code for different platforms (the target) other than the one the compiler runs (the host).

Rust lacks a garbage collector. The compiler keeps track of memory. It frees the memory when not in use and makes it available when needed. Runtime memory bugs are minimal since Rust enforces memory rules at compile time.

C++ has special standard libraries for extreme low-level purposes. By sacrificing the actual standard library, you can operate on device drivers even with no existing operating system.

#### Convenience
Rust utilizes [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) compiler infrastructure, ensuring that the same back-end optimizations for C++ are also available for Rust.

In addition, the LLVM has comprehensive platform support and is open-source. This is significant for IoT applications since most of them share common design technologies.

[Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) provides a tooling and frontend infrastructure for C++ and other languages in the C language family. As an LLVM native, Clang empowers C++ to deliver fast compiles, error and warning messages. It also creates a platform for integrated source-level debugging.

Examples of tools you can build using the Clang frontend as a library to parse C++ code include [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) and [Clang Static Analyzer](https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/). These tools automatically find bugs in your code.

Rust has a package manager known as [Cargo](https://crates.io/) that builds and tests Rust applications.

Cargo is suited for multiplatform-oriented projects. By compiling tools from other sources, Cargo ensures you have a rich environment for building your IoT applications.

#### Performance
High execution speeds are achieved if a programming language can compile directly to the target hardware. Making builds for production and testing builds is straightforward with a common Rust codebase.

Rust safety guarantees compile-time checks with runtime additions that are only baked when the need arises. The outcome is C-like speed with high-level language semantics. This is essential to decrease space use and time complexity, especially with limited resources on IoT hardware.

C++ is a high-level language and needs to be compiled down. The electronic cables and switches contained in a computer only work with binary 0s and 1s. You need to translate your code (using a compiler) from C++ to a machine language that the CPU understands.

### Conclusion
IoT is becoming more and more immersed in our daily lives, and many connected devices are finding their way into our homes and workplaces. The choice of the programming language for IoT development is critical to increasing the adoption of IoT.

In this article, we have looked at IoT development with Rust and C++, there are other programming languages used for this purpose. It would help to consider your project needs before choosing either Rust or C++ for your IoT development.
