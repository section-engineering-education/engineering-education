### Prerequisites
1. A powerful server where the DPA (Database Performance Analyzer) can be installed.
2. A repository database.
3. Customer portal account to help access licenses and downloads. The customer portal can be accessed [here](https://customerportal.solarwinds.com/).
4. A local administrator account to be used by the server hosting DPA.
5. Updated operating system.
6. Open the following ports on the server and firewall: `8124`, `8123`, `8127`, `443`, `80`, and `587`.
7. Exclude the DPA folder directory from antivirus scanning to ensure a smooth installation.

### Installing the DPA on Windows

### How to register the database instances for monitoring
Identifying the privileged user:
- The privileged user can create a new monitoring user or grant access to an existing user who can monitor.

> Note: The privileged user's credentials are not stored by the DPA.

- The privileged user must be a system administrator for self-managed SQL server database instance: SYSADMIN (system administrator).

#### Stage 1: Process initiation
Tap the button for `Register DB Instance for Monitoring` on the DPA homepage.

![Select Register Instance](/engineering-education/setting-up-solar-windows-database-analyzer-for-monitoring-microsoft-sql-server/select-register-instance.png)

#### Stage 2: Database selection
Click Microsoft SQL Server under `Self-Managed`.

![SQL Self-mananged](/engineering-education/setting-up-solar-windows-database-analyzer-for-monitoring-microsoft-sql-server/sql-self-managed.png)

#### Stage 3: Input connection information
Select `Next` and finish the other steps as described below:
- Input the connection information for the Monitored DB instance.
- When the service for SQL server browser is available, enter the IP address or hostname along with the name of the instance, in the following format: `Server\Instance`.
- Otherwise, input the name of the server or its IP address, along with the port number, if necessary.

> Note: Each instance must be registered separately.

- Choose the authentication method.
- DPA can use the SYSADMIN login to register instances.
- In the SYSADMIN user field, type the domain username that was used for Windows authentication.
- Enter the credentials for authenticating the SQL server.
- By default, SSL is requested.

### Monitoring Database using Solar Winds DBA
Now that we have successfully installed the Database Performance Analyzer, we can now look at the most useful features of the solution. 

In the section below, we will take a look at five most important features and functions that database administrators would find very useful.

These functions include:

#### Database performance optimization
![Database performance optimization](/engineering-education/setting-up-solar-windows-database-analyzer-for-monitoring-microsoft-sql-server/optimization.png)

With Solarwinds, it is possible to identify bottlenecks and pinpoint exactly where the problem is arising. This in turn help the database administrator make the necessary adjustment and solve the problem as fast as possible. 

In addition to that, the solution offers direct visibility into issues of poorly performing applications long before they can cause huge errors.

Through the solutionâ€™s machine learning-powered anomaly detection, it becomes very easy to know exactly what needs to be tuned for the database to be at optimum performance. 

This particular function helps in the identification of inefficient workloads and heavy queries that affect overall database performance.

#### Resource usage
![Resource Usage](/engineering-education/setting-up-solar-windows-database-analyzer-for-monitoring-microsoft-sql-server/resources.png)

Resource utilization and allocation form a big part of database performance and it is, therefore, crucial to keep track of this information. DPA offers the user high-level visibility into how resources are utilized. With Solar Winds DPA, the database administrator has access to computation metrics such as disk, CPU, memory, and network usage. 

#### Detailed issue analysis reports
![Analysis Reports](/engineering-education/setting-up-solar-windows-database-analyzer-for-monitoring-microsoft-sql-server/reports.png)

Solar winds DPA offers a multidimensional performance analysis of the database with a central view of all variables related to the database. DPA identifies all faults within a database including inefficient queries and poorly scripted SQL statements. This kind of visibility is whatâ€™s needed for seamless and efficient database administration. 

#### Automated notifications
![Notifications](/engineering-education/setting-up-solar-windows-database-analyzer-for-monitoring-microsoft-sql-server/notifications.png)
 
The Solar winds DBA tool has an automated notification system that enables the system administrator and other responsible parties to be notified of any critical alerts. Further, these reports can be customized to suit the organization and user needs.

#### Query tuning advice
![Query Advisor](/engineering-education/setting-up-solar-windows-database-analyzer-for-monitoring-microsoft-sql-server/query_advisor.png)
 
Solar winds database performance analyzer uses information acquired to provide the user with insight and predictions through a feature known as table tuning advisor.

### Best practices
The best practice for the installation and configuration process is as follows:
- Enable AES 256 encryption and use a unique passcode.
- Make sure the HTTP connector is turned on.
- Disable insecure protocols and make sure that CA server certificates are used.
  
### Conclusion
Monitoring of the database is important to any application's upkeep. Early detection of database issues can help keep the resource healthy and accessible. 

Database outages can go undiscovered until it's too late, resulting in a loss of money and clients if there's no solid monitoring in place. This is precisely why organizations should use a database monitoring tool.

Happy coding!
