![protractor](/engineering-education/testing-angular-app-with-protractor-and-jasmine/protractor.jpg)
In this tutorial, we will be looking at writing a test for an Angular-enabled website created using protractor and jasmine. We will navigate to www.video.blender.org. Then we will first grab the angular enabled search input DOM elements using protractor API methods, then search for "free" videos by programmatically inputting the text we which to search then we will check the DOM interaction it causes. Based on our expectations we are bound to get one or more free videos available. The result causes an interactive change which will be our action to test for in our test case using jasmine.

### Prerequisite

### Introduction
If you are into the tech world, you must have heard of testing and the various types of testing and how testing helps create better resilient applications. Testing in the world of software development is a way to establish certainty that an application with a set of stated functionalities will perform those functions without fail. It is the process of running your software through series of checks using either manual or automated tools to ascertain its effectiveness. During software development, errors are bound to happen and testing makes it possible for those errors to be detected and corrected before the software is released. A well-tested software is reliable, secured, and highly accountable. It saves cost in the long run and helps prevent both wastes of manpower and resources.
At the end of this tutorial you should have an idea of how to manipulate the DOM to get elements you want, know how to perform actions on interactive elements, and also test expected outcomes.

### Terms and Terminologies
* [Protractor](https://www.protractortest.org/#/) is a NodeJs program built on top of WebDriverJs that supports the Jasmine test framework and is used as an end-to-end test framework for Angular applications.
* [AngularJs](https://angularjs.org/) is an open-source javascript framework used to build front-end applications.
* End-to-End refers to the test that is being carried out for operations that flow through the various modules that make up your angular application flow. e.g Registration to Login to Profile to Logout can be an end to end test flow. While each module here, Registration or Login can have unit test operate on them.
* [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) is an open-source, behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.
* [WebDriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webdriver-manager) Js is the official Javascript implementation of selenium. It helps to interact with elements on the web. Protractor extends what WebDriverJs can do and enables automation and interactions of possible user events that may occur on the browser application.

### Why protractor
If you open a non-angular webpage on the browser you have an element that users can interact with. These elements may be an input field, or dropdown tab, or clickable buttons, all these elements can be tested for using selenium testing tool, which can handle the automation of the tests for the individual elements, but when you have a website built using angularJs, angularJs introduce to the DOM extra properties which are specific to angular applications like ng-model, ng-repeater or ng-controller and these properties sit on top of natural HTML Dom elements. These properties introduce by angular are not visible to selenium and so cannot be captured by selenium to test them. Protractor however enables you the ability to capture these elements introduced by angular. In addition, protractor provides you specific locator strategies and functions like waitForAngular, By.binding, WebElement.evaluate e.t.c which gives you a variety of options to perform your tests.
Also, with selenium WebDriver alone, there are a lot of synchronization issues related to using bare selenium. Angular (like pure Javascript) is mostly asynchronous throughout and makes use of promises to handle async calls and callbacks.
A lot of applications are created using angular and angularjs and so a tool is needed to carry out the automation of these kinds of applications.
Here is a reference to best style guides for protractor testing [ Protractor style guide ](https://www.protractortest.org/#/style-guide)

### Why jasmine
Jasmine is a well-documented open-source Behavior Driven Development testing framework for JavaScript that does not rely on browsers, DOM, or any JavaScript framework. Other testing frameworks include Jest and Mocha. Jasmine is recommended over the others because AngularJs CLI comes chipped by default with Jasmine as the test runner and it is relatively easy to learn. But you can still configure the others to test angular-built web applications.

##### Jasmine syntax
Suites: A Suite defines/describes your tests
A suite is identified by a description function. The describe function is used to group specs that serve the same meaning. Just like in a component of a system or set of actions that can be grouped. The first parameter is a string value that is used as an identifier for a set of tests defined within the function body.
```javascript
 describe("A String that specifies a suite", function() {
     it("Contains an expectation", () => {
         let value = true;
         expect(value).toBe(true);
     });
 });
```

##### Specs
You can define a spec by using a global function called "it". "it", is similar in syntax to describe in that it takes a string as its first parameter and as its second parameter a function. The string parameter determines the title of the spec and is used to identify the spec when they are multiple specs present. The "function" on the other hand defines the spec or test. A spec can contain multiple expectations described using the "expect" statement ( which will be discussed later ) and is used to test the state of the code.
An expectation on its own can amount to either one of the following.
Either it amounts to true and the expectation passes or false it amounts to false and the expectation fails. If all the expectations in a test pass it means the test itself passes but if an expectation fails then the test in turn will be a failed test.

##### It
It in a nutshell is a function. They can include executable code required to carry out the test needed. Since jasmine is a javascript testing framework, javascript variable scope applies in the same way it does with normal javascript codes. a variable defined within a function is a local variable and is visible only with that particular function. This helps you plan out your data sharing between "It" blocks. If you want to share data between test blocks just use a global variable.

##### Expect
They are created using the functions and takes in a value called actual. "it" is being appended with a Matcher function. This can take in an argument that is the expected value.

##### Matchers
A matcher is an implementation of a boolean outcome. i.e The result of a matcher checks to confirm if something is either true or it is false. In this case, it checks the outcome of the expectation against a given outcome/value. If there is a match or there is none ( depending on the test case ), will determine if the test passes or if the test fails. In
Jasmine, you will find a huge set of matchers that can help you achieve the expectation you want to test for. These can be found in the API docs

### Setup and configuration
 
- Download and install [nodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 
Next, you install protractor globally so it can be accessed anywhere
```npm install -g protractor```
 
Next, run the command
 
```webdriver-manager update```
 
Create a conf.js file in the root directory of your angular application and input the following.
 
```javascript
 exports.config = {
     directConnect: 'http://localhost:4444/wd/hub',
     specs: ['./*-spec.js’],
     framework: ‘jasmine’,
 };
```
* The "directConnect: true" option specifies where to talk to your Selenium Server (seleniumAddress). It will use the defaults for all other configurations. Chrome is the default browser.
* The option for the "specs" should be the path to the spec javascript file which will be run when the test is being executed.
* The "framework" property specifies the test framework to use. in our case it’s jasmine.
For now, these basic configurations will get your test up and running.
. [ Protractor API ](https://www.protractortest.org/#/api-overview) for any specific issues.
The value for the specs in the above code tells protractor to check the current directory and execute all files that have the letters "-spec.js" as their ending characters. This makes use of relative paths to files.
 
Create a test-spec.js file anywhere you see fit in the root directory. Here you will write your tests. For now, test using the code below in your test
Install Jasmine as a dependency if it is not already installed
 
``` npm install —save-dev jasmine ```
 
On your terminal navigate to the directory where the conf.js  file is located and run the command to begin your testing
``` protractor conf.js ```

### Testing
For this test, we will be carrying out a test on a popular website created using the angularJs framework. We will first navigate to the page in the search. We will then navigate to www.video.blender.org. Since this website is built with angularJs we will make use of protractor to capture the elements we need to manipulate. In this case, we will capture a search input element located at the top right corner of the page. Then we will proceed to search requests for free videos by performing functions made available to us in the protractor API that suits what we want to perform., Finally, we will check the DOM interaction it causes. It is expected that video-blender will have available free videos and that a list of those free videos will be inserted in the DOM page layout and replace the initial webpage loaded list of available videos. This will represent the interaction we expect. Performing another search for a non-existing word should also produce a change to display the result of the search.


* First we will create the describe function the will house our test. The string specifies the name of this block of test we will be writing. The second parameter is a function that our specs will be written within.

```javascript
describe("Testing exercise for protractor and Javascript application", function(){


    })
```

* The changes we have made will be to insert our spec. This specifies a set of related tests we will be writting. Same as the desribe it has a string parameter that specifies what the test does and a function that will house the various tests. Note that the function is an asynchronous function, and has the parameter "done". This is the specifies that some operations within this function will not occur in an instance and may occur later in the future but then we want the normal operations to halt its flow and not continue execution until that operation is completed. Such operations are marked with the await keyphrase.
The done() method is a function caller for the argument passed into the function and is called at the end of all tests to mark the end of testing the spec.

```javascript
describe("Testing exercise for protractor and Javascript application", function(){
    it("Navigate to Blender Video search for videos",  async function(done){
   
        done();
    })
})
```

* Looking at the code below, we have added a couple of lines to it. First we are saving into the variable "url", a string to link to the angularJs powered website we want to carry out our test on. The we are making use of a protractor API method (browser.get()) to make a request to the link specified. This method does get the page in an instance but takes a while and because we need its completion inorder to proceed to the next round we specify the await keyword telling it to further pause execution until the page is returned.


```javascript
describe("Testing exercise for protractor and Javascript application", function(){
    it("Navigate to Blender Video search for videos",  async function(done){
        let url = "https://video.blender.org/"
        await browser.get(url);
        done();
    })
})
```
 
* Here we have written our first test. we are expecting the current page we are on to be the page we searched for. For this we also make use of protractor API method (browser.getCurrentUrl()) to achieve this.

* We then now go ahead to grab elements we need to perform further test from the DOM. With the aid of the browser inspection tool we can highlight specific elements we want to grab and get infomation on how to grab them. Based on the element, you can get them using -  it's id, class, xPath, css Selector or tag. Be sure to grab it using the most stable method one unlikely to change.
We are grabing the search inptu element (searchBar), the search button click (searchButton), and the result element (searchResult). 

```javascript
describe("Testing exercise for protractor and Javascript application", function(){
    it("Navigate to Blender Video search for videos",  async function(done){
        let url = "https://video.blender.org/"
        await browser.get(url);

        expect(await browser.getCurrentUrl()).toBe(url);

        let searchBar = element(by.css('#search-video'));
        let searchButton = element(by.css('.icon-search'));
        let searchResult = element(by.css('.search-result'));

        done();
    })
})
```

* For the "searchBar", we are inputting a string value we want to test for ("free") then making a click action on the "searchButton" variable. We are expecting the 'searchResult' element to be visible on the page after the search has been made hence we test for the present of the css style "display":"block".


```javascript
describe("Testing exercise for protractor and Javascript application", function(){
    it("Navigate to Blender Video search for videos",  async function(done){
        let url = "https://video.blender.org/"
        await browser.get(url);

        expect(await browser.getCurrentUrl()).toBe(url);

        let searchBar = element(by.css('#search-video'));
        let searchButton = element(by.css('.icon-search'));
        let searchResult = element(by.css('.search-result'));
        
         
        searchBar.sendKeys("free");

        searchButton.click();
        
        expect(searchResult.getCssValue('display')).toBe('block');

        done();
    })
})
```
* We then make a further tests for a none existing search result ("neverdwelt"). We do not clear the text in the search bar so our search gets appended to the existing "free" text in the search bar. If you want to clear the search bar so as to make a new search uses the code.

```javascript
    searchBar.clear().then(function() {
    searchBar.sendKeys('neverdwelt');
    })

```

So, without changing the existing text, we append to it "neverdwelt" and programmatically trigger the search button. We are expecting the same outcome as the first, it should display the search result only in this case there are no elements in the list 


```javascript
describe("Testing exercise for protractor and Javascript application", function(){
    it("Navigate to Blender Video search for videos",  async function(done){
        let url = "https://video.blender.org/"
        await browser.get(url);

        expect(await browser.getCurrentUrl()).toBe(url);

        let searchBar = element(by.css('#search-video'));
        let searchButton = element(by.css('.icon-search'));
        let searchResult = element(by.css('.search-result'));
        
         
        searchBar.sendKeys("free");

        searchButton.click();
        
        expect(searchResult.getCssValue('display')).toBe('block');
        
        searchBar.sendKeys('neverdwelt');
        searchButton.click();
        
        expect(searchResult.getCssValue('display')).toBe('block');
        done();
    })
})
```

You should see a Chrome browser window open up and navigate to the webpage specified perform a search and carry out the test. The test output should be 1 test, 1 assertion, 0 failures. Congratulations, you've run your first Protractor test!

### Conclusion
There are a lot of options present which we can use to capture DOM elements so we can use and manipulate them.
Also available are methods that can be used to provide interaction with the elements on the page.
