### Introduction
 In [PHP(Hypertext Preprocessor)](https://www.php.net/), we have different types of operators depending on the number of operands they take. For example, some operators take only one operand and operate on it. Unary operators are the name for these types of operators. A binary operator, which takes two operands, is another form of operator.

### Prerequisites

1.  Xampp for `Linux` downloaded on your machine. You can download the latest version [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) or follow [this]() steps on how to download.
2. Little knowledge of PHP

3. Type Editor like [Visual studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or any other depending on your taste.

`NB`
To run any PHP file, You must first start `Xampp`. This is done using this command.

```bash
$ sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start

Starting XAMPP for Linux 8.0.5-0...
XAMPP: Starting Apache...ok.
XAMPP: Starting MySQL...ok.
XAMPP: Starting ProFTPD...ok.
```

#### Different between an Operator and an Operand

To understand the difference, let us look at the example below:

```PHP
   $num=10+20;`
 ```  

  In the above example  `+` is the `operator` while `10` and `20` are `Operands`

 An  `Operator` is a symbol used to perform operations on operands/variables. 

 `Operand` is the object being acted upon. 10 and 20 are being added in the above example. 

 NB. `$(dollar)` sigh is used to create a variable `num` which holds the values 10 and 20.

 #### Creating a php file in Xampp

 Now that we know what an operator and an operand are, let us start working with them. To do that we have to create a `PHP file` in Xampp. 

 After downloading xampp, you will notice that a folder `/opt/lampp/htdocs` will be created. Open  `/opt/lampp/htdocs` using terminal to create a file. To open, type:

 ```bash
 $ cd /opt/lampp/htdocs
 ```
 Let us create a folder `operators` in `htdocs` which we will use to store all our files.

Type the command below to create:
```bash
$ sudo mkdir operators
```
To create a php file in `/opt/lampp/htdocs/operators`, type:

```bash
$ cd /opt/lampp/htdocs/operators 
$ sudo nano touch example.php
```
The above command will create a PHP file called `example.php` in the operators' folder. We will use this file later. 

#### Arithmetic Operators
These are operators that are used on the operator to execute arithmetic operations.

There are various Arithmetic operators supported by PHP:

1. Addition Operator(+)  - They add two operands.

2. Subtraction Operator(-) - Subtract the second operand from the first operand.

3. Muitiplacation Operators (*) - These multiply two operands.

4. Division Operator (/) - Divide numerator by de-numerator

5. Increment operator (++) - Increases integer value by one

6. Decrement Operator (--) Decreases an operator value by one.

Below is an example to demonstrate PHP Arithmetic Operators.

Open the file we created (`example.php` ) using [Gedit](https://help.gnome.org/users/gedit/stable/), enter the following code snippet, and save. To open, navigate in `/opt/lampp/htdocs/operators` and  type:
```bash
$ sudo gedit example.php
```

```php
<?php
$x=50;
$y=30;
echo "x+y = ";
echo $x + $y . '<br/>';  
echo "x-y = ";
echo $x - $y . '<br/>'; 
echo "x*y = ";
echo $x * $y . '<br/>';
echo "x/y = ";
echo $x / $y . '<br/>'; 
echo "++x = ";
echo ++$x . '<br/>';
echo "--x = ";
echo --$x . '<br/>';
echo "++y = ";
echo ++$y . '<br/>';
echo "--x = ";
echo --$y . '<br/>';
echo "x++ = ";
echo $x++. '<br/>';
echo "x-- = ";
echo $x--. '<br/>';
echo "y++ = ";
echo $y++ .'<br/>';
echo "y-- = ";
echo $y--. '<br/>';
?>
```
To run this code snipet, open your browser at http://localhost/operators/example.php. You should have an output similar to the one below:
Output

```php
x+y = 80
x-y = 20
x*y = 1500
x/y = 1.6666666666667
++x = 51
--x = 50
++y = 31
--x = 30
x++ = 50
x-- = 51
y++ = 30
y-- = 31
```
#### Comparison Operators
 Comparison Operators are used to compare two operands.  

They either return a true or false Boolean value. If the comparison is correct, it returns true else it returns false.

 PHP supports the following comparison operators.

1. Equality (==) - If both operands are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

2. Identity (===)-Return true if both operands have the same data type and are equal; otherwise, return false. 

3. Not Identical (!===)-If both operands are not equal or have the same data type, return true; otherwise, return false.

 4. Greater than (>)- Return true if the left operand is larger than the right operand; otherwise, return false.

5. Greater than or equal to(>=)- Return true if the left operand is greater or equal to the right operand; otherwise, return false.

6. Less than (<)- If the operand on the left is smaller than the operand on the right, return true; otherwise, return false. -->

7. Less than or equal(<=) - If the left operand is smaller than or equal to the right operand, return true; otherwise, return false. 

Lets have a look at Program that illustrate the working of a Comparison operators:
```php
<?php
$x = 100;  
$y = 100;
var_dump($x == $y) ; // returns true because values are equal . ""
echo"<br>";
var_dump($x === $y).'<br/>'; // returns false because types are not equal
echo"<br>";
var_dump($x != $y); // returns false because values are equal
echo"<br>";
var_dump($x !== $y); // returns true because types are not equal
echo"<br>";
var_dump($x > $y); // returns true because $x is greater than $y
echo"<br>";
var_dump($x <= $y); // returns true because $x is less than or equal to $y
echo"<br>";
var_dump($x < $y); // returns true because $x is less than $y
echo"<br>";
var_dump($x <= $y); // returns true because $x is less than or equal to $y
?>
```
Output
```
bool(true)
bool(true)
bool(false)
bool(false)
bool(false)
bool(true)
bool(false)
bool(true)  
```
#### String Operators
In PHP we have two string operators:

. `concatenation operator` ('.') -Returns the right and left arguments concatenated.

. `concatenation assignment operator`  ('.=') -  Appends the right-hand argument to the left-hand argument.

A. Following `concatenation operator` we have the following Example:
```php
$a = "Hello ";
$b = $a . "World!"; // here, $b contains "Hello World!"
echo "$b";
?>
```
Output
```
Hello World! 
```
B. Following `concatenation assignment operator` we have the following Example:
```php
$a = "Good ";
$a .= "Work!"; // here, $a contains "Good Work!"
echo "$a";
?>
```
Output
```
Good Work! 
```
#### Assignment Operators
When writing a value to a variable in PHP, the `assignment` operators are used with numeric values.

 `"="` This operator signifies that the value of the assignment expression on the right is set to the left operand. It is the main assignment operator

In PHP we have the following types of assignments operators:
   
1) += Addition - It add and assign a new value to a variable. 
2) -= Subtraction  - It subtracts and assigns a new value to a value.
3) *=   Multiplication  -It multiplies and assign a new value to a valuable
 4) /=   Division - It divides and assigns a new value to a valuable. 
5) %= modules - The modulus of two numbers is computed and the result is assigned to the first. 

Below is a program that illustrate the working of assignment operators:
```php
<?php
$x = 50; 
$x1 = 100;
$x2 = 150;
$x3 = 200;
$x4 = 250;
$x += 100; // addition
echo "$x <br/>";
$x1-= 50; //subtraction
echo "$x1 <br/>";
$x2*= 2; // multiplacation
echo "$x2 <br/>";
$x3/= 2; //division
echo "$x3 <br/>";
$x4/= 4; //modules
echo "$x4 <br/>";
?>
```
output (The output is in the order of the program)
```
 150
 50
 300
 100
 62.5 
```
### Conclusion
Variables and functions are both used with operators to perform various operations.

In this article, we have looked at the various types of operators in PHP that are utilized to provide better facilities to customers based on their needs. Users can take actions based on the outcomes of several operators.

Thatâ€™s all folks! Happy Learning!
