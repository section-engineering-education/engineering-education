### How to use Prime-React to create a responsive navigation bar in React.js.
React.js is one of the leading frameworks used when creating web applications. It enables developers to create SEO-friendly and highly-interactive components. React.js features also boost maintenance and  productivity. The integration of Prime React components in React.js projects takes things to a new level.
 
### Introduction
Prime React is like CSS, which is used in styling the user interface of our application.
But unlike CSS, Prime React has pre-defined style in each components, which we can use in our React application.

### Prerequisites
For this tutorial, make sure that you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your computer. We will use npm to download and install the required dependencies in our application. You also need a code editor. This tutorial uses visual studio code, which you can download from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
The reader must have a good understanding of the following concepts:
- Basic knowledge of React.js
- Little knowledge on npm

### Goal
To create a responsive navigation bar using Prime React components in a React.js application.
To use Prime React components in our project.

Let's start coding.

### What is Prime React:
Prime React is a collection of rich set of open source UI components for react. it allows us to import and use different components to create a user interface in our React applications.
Prime React is developed by Prime Tek informatics, a vendor with years of expertise in developing open source UI solutions including PrimeFaces, PrimeNG and PrimeVue.
To know more about PrimeReact open [this](https://www.primefaces.org/primereact)


### Step 1 - Getting Started
Navigate to your desired folder and create a React project by typing the following command in a terminal or cmd.

```bash
npm create-react-app my-prime
```

Once the installation is complete, open the folder in your code editor. Then, type `npm start` to launch the development server. You can view the default React application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

### Step 2 - Installing Prime React dependencies
We must install Prime React to access its different components. Open your terminal, and ensure that you are inside your application's master folder.

Type `npm install primereact --save` and press "enter" to install prime react
then `npm install primeicons --save` also press "enter" to install primeicons.

In addition, components need PrimeIcons library for icons and react-transition-group for animations.

```bash
 npm install react-transition-group
 ```
 to install react-transition-group.

We can confirm that the above dependencies have been installed by checking the package.json file. This is shown below

```JSON
"dependencies": {
    "primeicons": "^4.1.0",
    "primereact": "^6.6.0",
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.11.9",
    "@testing-library/react": "^11.2.3",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^12.6.0",
    "react": "^17.0.1",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.1",
    "react-scripts": "4.0.1",
    "react-transition-group": "^4.4.2",
    "web-vitals": "^0.2.4"
  },
```

### Step - 3 Modifying the project
By default, every React project comes with certain files and templates. For instance, when you navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`, you will notice that you have a web page with react logo. Let's eliminate these elements to avoid confusion. Open your app.js file and delete all the code in the div tag. 

```javascript
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {/* code goes here */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
We then import 

```javascript
import "primereact/resources/themes/vela-blue/theme.css";
import "primereact/resources/primereact.min.css";
import "primeicons/primeicons.css";
```

The above should be added at the top of the app.js file to enable primereact icons, theme and styles be effective in our browser.

Our app.js file should look like this below

```javascript
import './App.css';
import "primereact/resources/themes/vela-blue/theme.css";
import "primereact/resources/primereact.min.css";
import "primeicons/primeicons.css";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {/* code goes here */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Step 4 - Creating a Navigation bar 
We first need to create an independent component and import it into another file. For example, within the src folder, letâ€™s create a separate folder called component. Within the component folder we create a new file and name it NavBar.js. 
We then create a React function called Navigation, within the return parentheses we create a navigation bar for our browser using HTML elements like div tag, header tag and nav tag.

```javascript
const Navigation = () => {
    return(
        <div>
           <header>
              <nav>
                <h1>Prime React</h1>
                 <ul></ul>
              </nav>
           </header>
        </div>
    )
}

export default Navigation;
```

After this our Navigation function should be imported inside our app.js file, within the div of our app.js we add our Navigation function so as to make our Navigation code display on the browser

`import Navigation from './component/NavBar';` This should be at the top of our app.js file.

Within the div tag of our app.js file we add our Navigation element
```javascript
<div classname="App"> 
 <Navigation />
</div>. 
```

Css styles can be added to change the pre-defined styles.

### Step 5 - Making our Navigation Bar responsive 
To use PrimeReact components, we first need to import them into our project. we'll be using some prime react components such as Menubar, ProgressBar and Button components in this tutorial.

To use Menubar component, we import it inside our NavBar.js file, then add it within our nav tag HTML element to make it display within our Navigation 

```javascript
import { Button } from 'primereact/button';
import { Menubar } from 'primereact/menubar';
import { InputText } from 'primereact/inputtext';s
```

The above should be added at the top of our NavBar.js file, within our Navigation function we then create a const variable called items that will store an array of label.
This is shown below 
 
 ```javascript
 const items = [
        {label: 'Home', icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-home'},
        {label: 'Calendar', icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-calendar'},
        {label: 'Documentation', icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-file'},
        {label: 'Settings', icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-cog'}
    ]
```

Then we add Menubar, Button and InputText component within our nav tag inside our return React function. 

Our NavBar.js file should look like this

```javascript
import { Button } from 'primereact/button';
import { Menubar } from 'primereact/menubar';
import { InputText } from 'primereact/inputtext'
import './Nav.css'

const Navigation = () => {
     const items = [
        {label: 'Home', icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-home'},
        {label: 'Calendar', icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-calendar'},
        {label: 'Documentation', icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-file'},
        {label: 'Settings', icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-cog'}
    ];
    return(
        <div className='navigation'>
            <header>
                <h1>Prime React</h1>
                 <nav>
                    <ul>
                        <li><Menubar
                            model={items}
                            start={<InputText placeholder="Search" type="text"/>}
                            end={<Button label="PrimeReact" icon="pi "/>}
                        /></li>    
                       
                    </ul>
                </nav>
            </header>
           
        </div>
    )
}
export default Navigation;
```
The items variable will store what will be displayed on our Navigation bar. 

>You can read more about Menubar components from [here](https://primefaces.org/primereact/showcase/#/menubar)

The navigation classname is used to change the pre-defined CSS styles of our React project. 
The above code makes our Navigation bar responsive on all device screen size.
We can change the style or theme of our Prime React components if it's not styled . You can read more about Prime React theme from [here](https://primefaces.org/primereact/showcase/#/theming)

### Step 6 - Adding Prime React components to our project
We can also import and use a ProgressBar component in our project.
First we import it from primereact 

```javascript
import { ProgressBar } from 'primereact/progressbar';"
```

The above code must be placed within the app.js file, then we add the ProgressBar element inside our div tag.
```javascript
<div classname="App"> 
 <Navigation /> 
 <br /> 
 <ProgressBar value={value} /> 
</div>. 
```

This will display our progressbar below our navigation.

ProgressBar has two modes; `determinate` (default) and `indeterminate`. In determinate mode, a value between 0 and 100 is needed to display the progress. 

We can also import and use a InputText component in our project, as highlighted below

```javascript
import { InputText } from 'primereact/inputtext';"
```

 Like our Progress Bar we also import our InputText inside app.js file, then add it inside our div tag.
 
 ```javascript
<div classname="App"> 
 <Navigation /> 
 <br /> 
 <ProgressBar value={value} /> 
 <br />
 <InputText/>

</div>. 
```

  When you refresh your browser, you will see an empty input text under the progressbar.

We can also import and use a Button component in our project.
We first import in inside our app.js then add it to our div tag

```javascript
import { Button } from 'primereact/button';". 
```

Then we import it inside our div tag

 ```javascript
 <div classname="App"> 
 <Navigation /> 
 <br /> 
 <ProgressBar value={value} /> 
 <br />
 <InputText/>
 <br />
 <Button label="Click Me" />

</div>.
```

When you refresh your browser, you will see a button with the words "Click Me". But, this button will not be styled. We can add more styles to the button by adding an i tag within it. You can read more about Prime React Button components from [here](https://primefaces.org/primereact/showcase/#/button)

The Prime React button that we imported in the project is styled, as shown below.

```javascript
 <Button label="Click Me" >
 <i className="pi pi-spin pi-spinner" style={{'fontSize': '4px'}}></i>
 </Button> 
 ```

In summary, our entire code in app.js file is displayed below\

```javascript
import './App.css';
import 'primereact/resources/themes/vela-blue/theme.css'
import 'primereact/resources/primereact.min.css'
import 'primeicons/primeicons.css';
import Navigation from './Comps/Nav';
import { InputText } from 'primereact/inputtext'
import { Button } from 'primereact/button';
import { ProgressBar } from 'primereact/progressbar';

const App = () =>{    
  return(
    <div className="App">
      <Navigation />
      <br/>
      <ProgressBar mode="indeterminate" /> 
      <br/>
      <InputText/>
      <Button label="Click" >
        <i className="pi pi-spin pi-spinner" style={{'fontSize': '4px'}}></i>
      </Button>  
    </div>
  )
}
export default App;
```
