Today, fintech companies are dealing with mass data. They need to find ways to transform this data into a valuable state quickly. Otherwise, such data would become less beneficial.

These organizations require a fast and effective method to transfer collected data into their analytical systems. Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) technology was the conventional choice before the cloud became a mainstay for these companies.

But now, companies are contemplating moving towards Extract, Load, and Transform (ELT) technology. Cloud services favor this form of technology. The reverse order of the processes is not the only difference that ETL and ELT have, but their efficiency when dealing with big data. 

Fintech companies may favor an ELT approach due to its better handling of high volume, velocity, veracity, value, and variety of data. This article compares ELT and ETL technologies in terms of their application in extracting fintech data. It also discusses popular ETL and ELT tools.

### An overview of ETL and ELT
ETL stands for Extract, Transform, and Load. ELT is an abbreviation for Extract, Load, and Transform. ETL has been the conventional approach for data management for many years. Shifts towards ELT are increasingly becoming popular since fintech companies started embracing cloud-based services.

The extraction process refers to obtaining data from a source, reading and storing it. During transformation, data undergoes conversion into an acceptable format for a particular database. Loading refers to stacking data in a database. These three processes underline the basis for the ETL and ELT processes and their importance to fintech companies.

### ETL vs ELT
Both ETL and ELT are data integration processes that combine data from several sources then load it into a data target system. The primary difference between ETL and ELT lies in the sequence of activities. In ETL, data transformation occurs on a staging area before loading it to the target. But in ELT, an organization can load its raw data on the target system and convert it later to create value.

ELT allows direct loading of raw data. In this case, ELT is preferable when dealing with high-volume and unstructured data. Often, raw data comes in various forms and does not make much sense until processed. But ELT does not need you to organize the data when loading, so it is preferable for data extraction and loading. On the other hand, ETL is undesirable when dealing with big data. It is most valuable when extracting a limited amount of data because it requires data to transform before loading it into a database.

ETL is a time-intensive process. It requires loading data into the staging server for transformation and later to the target system. ETL process cannot proceed unless data transformation is complete. ELT saves time because data loading skips the staging server. Since data transformation occurs as the final step, it becomes easier to load large amounts of data in a short time.

Besides, ETL is an easier-to-implement process compared to ELT. Notably, ELT requires a deep knowledge of tools and skills to execute. These needs make its implementation more complex, unlike ETL. These two data integration processes also differ in their support for data warehouses. ETL supports on-premise and structured data. Since ELT uses cloud infrastructure, it supports both structured and unstructured data.

Also, ELT and ETL differ in their levels of maturity. ETL has been in existence for the last [two decades](https://www.guru99.com/etl-vs-elt.html). Its applications are known, and best practices are easy to access. However, ELT is relatively new. Its immaturity is one of the reasons for its complexity during implementation.

### Should you use ETL or ELT for fintech data?
#### What is fintech data?
Fintech data is found in organizations like banks and financial organizations. The most renowned ones include [Wall Street, Crypto, and real estate investment companies](https://www.analyticssteps.com/blogs/big-data-fintech-benefits-and-importance). The common thing their data has is its big data characteristics. It comes in large volumes and velocities, different varieties, and high integrity. 

This data comes unstructured, yet it requires intensive processing to create meaning. Every detail matter because financial information is sensitive. Fintech data helps organizations to forecast their clientele behavior. It is also critical in making correct predictions of the risks they face. Thus, these organizations need a system that can handle big data and help them make good decisions.

#### Why is ELT more suitable for fintech data?
The characteristics of fintech data make ELT the best data integration approach for such firms. ELT can handle big data because it deals with structured and unstructured data. Besides, it does not need to transform data before loading it on a target system. 

Fintech companies value speed because data is massive and requires urgent analysis. So, ELT is their best choice as it can perform data loading and transformation in parallel. The high speeds and flexibility in ELT make it advantageous because they can handle fintech data regardless of its structure. Fintech companies want to extract data and load it up fast without sorting it every time. Because ELT allows firms to load up raw data, it becomes the best choice for data integration.

#### ETL and ELT security
ETL and ELT have significant differences in their ability to confer adequate data security. The differences relate to their differences in maturity. They are also a result of their different approaches to data transfer from a data warehouse to the target system.

ETL is more secure than ELT because it allows businesses to transform data before loading it up in the target system. This step gives organizations a window to make security adjustments. An organization can make light changes to data to remove confidential information or encrypt it. 

It also gets the chance to [format functions](https://www.xplenty.com/blog/etlg-etl-data-governance/) for data governance, limiting unauthorized access to data. The pre-loading security transformations make ETL a more secure data integration approach than ELT. ELT faces security issues because it loads data without first transforming it. 

Information remains [unmasked until transformed](https://www.xplenty.com/blog/security-and-elt-a-tragedy/), increasing vulnerability to unauthorized access and use. Experts like data scientists and analysts may pull this data into business intelligence tools and illegally expose an organization's data. A breach of data security could result in loss of client trust and adverse financial repercussions.

Besides, organizations may pick corrupted data in their systems if they fail to filter received data. By skipping transformation in the early stages, an organization collects data indiscriminately. It is challenging to differentiate corrupted data from uncompromised data in this case. Such an organization may become vulnerable to cyber-attacks.

The ELT approach makes compliance and data governance complicated. The methodology may violate regulatory policies, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ([HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html)) and General Data Protection Regulation ([GDPR](https://www.cookiebot.com/en/gdpr-usa/)). Concerns about the potential data breaches may create compliance challenges with those policies. Thus, an organization may face legal battles seeking confirmation to secure data integration approaches.

Also, ELT's immaturity makes its security questionable. Because it is newer, it lacks adequate [established implementation tools](https://www.xplenty.com/blog/security-and-elt-a-tragedy/). An organization has a small pool of tools to choose from and could make errors when picking the tools. Besides, it lacks an adequate talent pool because few specialists have ventured into ELT. A combination of these factors results in reduced optimization of data pipelines. Ultimately, they lead to increased data security vulnerability.
