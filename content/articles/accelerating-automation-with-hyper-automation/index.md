The merging of artificial intelligence with robotic process automation has elevated it further. It can now undertake virtual tasks previously reserved for employees.

### Hyperautomation vs. intelligent automation
Hyperautomation and intelligent automation appear interchangeable terms. However, there are some distinctions between these processes. The two have related underlying principles but have discernable differences in field applications.

Intelligent automation primarily uses robotic process automation, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and business process management. It helps to streamline tasks within an organization by simplifying processes. It also enhances decision-making and improves the efficiency of operations in businesses.

The primary differentiating factor for hyperautomation from intelligent automation is its higher advancement. It combines more technologies, and its application is more expansive. 

Hyperautomation, in simpler terms, is automating everything in a firm that can become automatic. It uses technologies used in intelligence automation, such as [machine learning, artificial intelligence](/engineering-education/differences-between-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-and-deep-learning/), and [robotics process automation](/engineering-education/what-is-robotic-process-automation/). It also uses other technologies, such as optical character recognition, natural language processing, and intelligent document processing.

Automation focuses on accomplishing repetitive tasks. But, hyperautomation exploits business intelligence to optimize the employees' operations. It aims to quicken processes in an organization and boost human capabilities to work efficiently and minimize errors.

### How hyperautomation benefits businesses

#### Adding a competitive advantage
Every business now needs hyperautomation to maintain a competitive edge in the market. 

Hyperautomation enhances the employees' productivity. It potentiates the workforce's capabilities by reducing their effort and maximizing their talents. Employees now focus less on doing basic repetitive tasks like data entry. They can now spend more time on activities like building relationships with their customers. 

Hyperautomation increases the knowledge available to labor systems. Workers can now use more sophisticated technologies, eliminating the limits of each process in a firm.

#### Improving efficiency
Hyperautomation unifies corporate strategy and [optimizes end-to-end processes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666351121000450) in an organization. It makes organizational processes run more efficiently by reducing manual operations. The firm can direct more time and resources to achieve its ultimate goals.

The deep insights that come as a result of hyperautomation are essential for the elimination of business inefficiencies. You need to have a clear concept of what the company needs, its challenges, and areas of improvement. 

For many firms, this can get blurry because of a lack of business intelligence. Hyperautomation bestows a firm with advanced analytics capabilities. These help identify market trends and make predictions of business outcomes.

#### Promoting collaboration
Hyperautomation promotes team collaboration within an organization by linking every process in a firm. It also ensures that each employee has a direct linkage to the automation process. Thus, everyone's actions influence business operations. This connection ensures that employees work as teams with a similar goal.

#### Improving data management
Notably, hyperautomation works by integrating several technologies and processes. Its efficiency requires a constant flow of data between storage and the premise infrastructure. So, there is continuous communication between the core systems and data storage.

### How hyperautomation supports end-to-end automation
Hyperautomation supports end-to-end automation by combining the strengths of each of its technologies. It uses robotic process automation to mimic human behavior and AI to gather business intelligence significant for making critical business decisions. Additionally, it uses digital process automation platforms for orchestration.

Ultimately, hyperautomation enables businesses to become "hands-off" in many of their activities. By combining robotics process automation with AI, it allows organizations to apply intelligence across their operations. In that way, companies achieve the best returns and value for investment.

### Where can hyperautomation be applied?
Hyperautomation has a wide range of applications. It is applied in insurance companies, customer service operations, marketing, health care, and retail sectors.

#### Insurance
Insurance companies have a large labor force that engages in repetitive manual tasks. These firms deal with many claims every day that need similar procedures done over and over again. The application of hyperautomation technologies helps relieve insurance firms of these regular time-consuming processes.

Hyperautomation limits the amount of time that employees have to deal with data entry. They can then devote much of their time to other activities that add value to their company. 

This technology allows insurance companies to process their actions faster. It grants higher efficiency than the human workforce for tasks requiring repetitive procedures. Employees suffer less strain, ensuring higher productivity in these firms.

Besides, hyperautomation technologies, such as artificial intelligence, help give accurate market insights. Insurance companies can use such market knowledge to anticipate [probability claims](https://www.infobeans.com/hyperautomation-the-new-wave-of-automation).
