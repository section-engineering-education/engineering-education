Why DevSecOps Need Security as Code

The introduction of DevOps made software development faster and simpler. Many firms found this product beneficial because it smoothened developing applications for the development teams. But DevOps had a challenge related to security implementation. DevSecOps was introduced to solve this problem.

DevSecOps utilizes security as code to bypass the security issues noted in DevOps. Security as code ensures that development teams define security at the start of the project. A software then undergoes repeated codification for consistent use.

This article discusses DevSecOps, security as a code and continuous delivery, which is a foundation for security as a code. It also discusses security as a code as a solution to risks in development and runtime.

### What is security as code

Security as code constitutes a toolset of resources that codify security and policy decisions in a DevOps setup. The aim of Security as Code is to protect the software development lifecycle. Since DevOps is [popular](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/security-as-code/) with many organizations, introducing security as code is crucial.

During the implementation of security as code, several scans and testing ensure that the continuous integration/continuous delivery pipeline stays protected from security bugs and other vulnerabilities. Security as code represents the next direction of DevOps in a time when businesses prioritize data safety. security as code couples application development with security management. It thus allows developers to focus on core features and software functionality.

### What is DevSecOps

DevSecOps stands for development, security, and operations. It is an approach that modifies DevOps to incorporate security as a shared responsibility for the whole software development lifecycle. It is a necessary solution for businesses. For many, the challenge of data security has been overwhelming, as noted by the continuous security breaches of applications and software. DevSecOps' security introduction in the application development cycle is critical in minimizing security issues that organizations experience. DevSecOps integrates application and infrastructure security into DevOps and agile processes. It grants a functionality level that can address security bugs as they develop, making tackling data security easy and faster.

### Continuous delivery as a foundation of security as code

Agile ideas and principles that facilitate frequent delivery and face-to-face collaboration form the foundation for DevSecOps. Continuous integration and delivery are fundamental agile development practices that create security as code. When a developer checks in a code change during continuous integration, the entire system is automatically rebuilt and tested. The process provides fast and frequent feedback about the [health of the codebase](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/devopssec/9781491971413/ch04.html). But continuous delivery is more than automating the building and testing process. It allows for automated provisioning and configuring testing environments that match production. Developers package the code and deploy it for testing in continuous delivery. They run acceptance and performance tests and communicate security status as code to the dashboard.

Continuous delivery forms a backbone for DevSecOps. It is an automated framework that makes secure software development more effective. It simplifies the process of effecting infrastructural changes in software and applications. Implementing a continuous delivery pipeline requires the collaboration of developers and operations. There must be a great understanding of how the system functions and how production appears. This mastery of the processes is vital in ensuring maximum cooperation between the developers, which is crucial for continuous delivery.

### How security as code enables development teams to address security

Security as code enables development teams to address security issues more proactively. DevSecOps teams can describe code according to the security goals they aim to achieve. Security as code enables these teams to tailor the security of their software and applications according to a specific organization's needs.

Security as code eases the work of DevSecOps teams by enhancing the collaboration of development teams. Initially, when DevSecOps was inexistent, there was a gap between security and development teams. It was common for development teams to ignore or subvert security processes that had not yet been updated. But now that there is security as code, collaboration for these teams on issues they share has yielded better security measures for software development. Development and security teams are not working on software with different motivations. Instead, they have begun working together by focusing on the [same code base](https://www.accurics.com/blog/security-blog/security-as-code-devsecops-future-of-security/) and ensuring that an application passes a test before proceeding to the next level.

Security as code has also helped development teams to address security by increasing visibility. It simplifies and centralizes data access, which provides visibility. Because of security as code, it is easy to track and request software changes according to an organization's changing needs. By centralizing data access, security as code also reduces the redundancy of various procedures. It becomes less necessary to repeat similar decisions in separate systems.

### How security as code addresses risks in development and runtime

Security as code has become a driving force for the evolution of software security. Many businesses investing in data security have found security as code crucial in implementing data protection measures. In particular, security as code is helping IT firms venturing into innovation to address their security challenges better than in the past.

Security as code is critical in helping organizations strengthen their software development life cycle by shifting attention to exploitable areas. Security as code automates meaningful pass or fail conditions in data pipelines. For instance, they could be set to break the software development process if it contains high-risk findings or is highly likely to expose sensitive data. This automation makes software development swift because organizations can quickly identify and fix security threats.

Unless an issue of high risk, no alerts are notable. Alerts by security as code point to a vulnerability in an application or software and necessitate its fixing. For this reason, security as code is a vital tool whose integration into DevSecOps enhances the security of the application development process. Security as code is gaining popularity, just like DevSecOps. It is a good fit for several software systems that use automation to deploy information. Security as code augments automated workflows to reduce security vulnerabilities before anyone exploits them.

Security as code has helped organizations overcome the challenge that DevOps technology experienced. Notably, DevOps had several security vulnerabilities that DevSecOps is now bridging through the help of security as code. Security as code eliminates manual steps required to strengthen application and software security. Doing so minimizes the mistakes that come as a result of manual coding. Security as code enhances the speed and consistency of making configuration changes. It bypasses the limitations of DevOps, which is why many firms are increasingly leaning towards integrating security as code in security systems.

Besides, security as code minimizes the risks of making errors during software and app development by reducing excessive reliance on [individual decision-making](https://www.globalsecuritymag.com/How-Security-as-Code-meets-new,20211101,117766.html). The automation process shifts the configuration of policies centrally. Evaluation of security systems occurs from a central point, and its application is transferred to all the projects. It becomes easy to repeat the processes while following the desired standards. All the projects uphold a security level that matches every other application or software made in a specific firm. However, there is a downside to this approach. If someone tampers with the security as code applied to all the projects, an entire firm's software development life cycle also suffers the devastating effects of the malicious attack.

### Conclusion

In the world today, cyber-security has become very crucial for every firm. Digitalization has made the need to protect data necessary for organizations to prevent unauthorized access. With the acceleration of the software and application development cycles under DevOps, integrating security as code to create DevSecOps became paramount. Security as code provides a viable option for organizations to instil security measures to safeguard their software development cycles.

Security as code has been integrated into DevSecOps to improve proactive security. It has transformed DevSecOps to introduce more secure processes that bar cybercriminals from infiltrating company apps and software. Throughout the development cycle, security as code allows for regular reviewing of input code. It identifies errors in code for correction. It can also stop the building process upon detecting malware attacks. So, security as code in DevSecOPs has made securing apps and software faster, simpler, and more effective.
