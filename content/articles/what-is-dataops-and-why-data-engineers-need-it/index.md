### Overview of DataOps
DataOps is a data management technique that aims to enhance data flow collaboration, integration, and automation between data management teams and data consumers across an organization. DataOps is a practice for DevOps, data analysts, data scientists, data engineers, developers, and IT operations collaborating in the entire service lifecycle from design to development to production support. 

DataOps uses agile, DevOps, and lean manufacturing methods. These elements come together to form a reliable data architecture that provides valuable insights to stakeholders of any enterprise.

#### 1. Agile methodology
Agile methodology is prevalent among software development teams. It allows them to build applications fast. DataOps, like Agile, focuses on continuous development and testing. However, implementing DataOps and Agile principles allows you to quickly obtain accurate data and deploy validated data, which speeds up product development and improves communication between development and data management teams.

#### 2. DevOps approach
DataOps applies the principles of DevOps concepts to data analytics. Its purpose is to increase analytic velocity and create analytical outcomes for data consumers. DataOps, like DevOps, supports the use of technological advancements that automate data governance and operational processes.

#### 3. Lean manufacturing
This approach focuses on improving and enhancing team efficiency while minimizing waste. DataOps, like lean manufacturing, uses [statistical process control (SPC)](https://asq.org/quality-resources/statistical-process-control#:~:text=Statistical%20process%20control%20(SPC)%20is,find%20solutions%20for%20production%20issues) to evaluate data analytics in the pipelines regularly. The ultimate goal is to maintain data quality and eliminate errors.

### Who is a DataOps engineer?
As businesses and organizations grow more digital, they must intelligently use massive amounts of data. To achieve this, you may need to hire a DataOps engineer to enable your organization to operationalize its data. DataOps engineers are not involved with the data. They automate, manage, and integrate processes and workflows. To build data products, they engineer the production environment and processes.

DataOps engineer owns the data pipelines and the general workflow while data scientists and developers operate inside the pipelines. A DataOps engineer's primary role is to help data engineers and analysts streamline the product development through implementing DevOps concepts towards the data pipeline.

### DevOps vs. DataOps
DevOps and DataOps are distinctive in their operations and performance. However, both use agile methodology. DevOps involves continuous integration and continuous deployment of software. It focuses on shortening the software development lifecycle through continuous development and automation. 

DevOps uses Agile development methodology, which improves time to value by reducing delivery time. As a result, software development projects become more profitable and efficient. DevOps requires collaboration among software developers and the IT operations team.

DataOps involves utilizing, transforming, and orchestrating data workflows. DataOps aims to use processes and tools to get data to people quickly. It is designed to produce quality data and analytics solutions faster and more efficiently. Building a data analytics platform requires collaboration among multiple data professionals or anyone who works with the data.

DevOps requires skills like:
- Software development.
- IT operations.
- Quality control.
- Applications integrations.
- Quality assurance.
- Security.

DataOps skills are more diverse. They may include:
- Data management.
- Data science.
- Data analysis.
- Data integration.
- Data security.
- Data engineering.
- Statistics.
- IT operations.
- Business.
- Data governance.

With DevOps, code is the essential item. However, data is the most critical aspect for DataOps. Software engineers who work with code do most of the work in DevOps. On the other hand, the end-users derive value from the data in DataOps.

DataOps is more than DevOps for data as the world is becoming more data-driven. Organizations no longer keep relying on technology to stay competitive. Data eliminates the need for guesswork when making well-informed decisions. It helps you find new sources of income and allows businesses to find out where the cost center is. Proper use of data determines a company's competitive advantage. Therefore, every organization needs to implement a DataOps strategy.

### Benefits of DataOps
We know what DataOps is, now let us look at how it benefits the businesses:
1. **Make work easier**: DataOps is about automation, which increases the efficiency of workers. With the help of intelligent testing and observation techniques in the analytics pipeline. Teams can maintain their focus on strategic goals.
2. **Better data quality**: Autonomous, repetitive practices, and intelligent code checks are used. You can reduce the possibility of a single human error spreading across multiple servers, causing the network to go down or producing inaccurate results. DataOps increases the value of data by improving the quality of data.
3. **Faster resolutions to problems**: With Agile methodology, you can have data updates in no time. Thus, problems are solved very fast. Reducing toil and enhancing data quality leads to a faster resolution to problems.
4. **Better customer experience**: To implement a good customer experience, organizations focus on analyzing customer data and feedback. DataOps enable enterprises to give their customers desired services and products faster.
5. **Security**: Security is essential whenever data is involved. Organizations handle piles of sensitive data about businesses, customers, employees, and more. With centralized analytics development, enterprises can ensure Security and governance while reducing the danger of data leaks.

### Steps of implementing a successful DataOps practice
A business's most essential assets are its people and its data. To get the total value of your data, you need to shift your data management strategies to be more collaborative, unified, and automated, which is accomplished through DataOps. 

Here are some points to consider when you implement DataOps principles to transform your company into a data-driven enterprise:
