[Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) is a virtualization platform used to deliver software in packages called containers. It allows an application to run instances inside of a container.  Docker has become very popular nowadays.

### Different Versions
Docker is divided into two categories:

Docker-CE is the Community Edition, this one is free to use. If any issue occurs, try to use the community forums and go through the documentation.

Docker-EE is the Enterprise Edition, which is a licensed and premium version of CE.

### Installation
- *For Ubuntu*:

First, update your packages:

```
 sudo apt update
```

Next, install docker with apt-get:

```
 sudo apt install docker.io
```

Finally, verify that docker is installed correctly:

```
 sudo docker version
```

You should see the installation details. It gives you information about the Client and Server version, the Go-lang version, so on and so forth.

If the output of your command is similar to the one below, Congrats!!!!!

```

- *For MacOSX*: you can follow this [link](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).

- *For Windows*: you can follow this [link](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/).

With the basic installation of Docker you’ll need to run the `docker` command as `sudo`. However, you can add your user to the `docker group`, and you’ll be able to run the commands without `sudo`.

```
 sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
 su - ${USER}
```

Running these commands will add your user to the `docker group`. To verify this, `run $ id -nG` and if you get back an output with your username in the list rest assured you did everything right.

### Creating Your First Docker Image

Now, let's create our first docker image by pulling it from Docker Hub. First let's search the Hub for an image called "hello-world"

```
docker search hello-world
```
This will list all the images called "hello-world". From the result, you can see the first image called "hello-world", pull the image and experiment with it.

```
docker pull hello-world
```
Result:

```
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
0e03bdcc26d7: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:49a1c8800c94df04e9658809b006fd8a686cab8028d33cfba2cc049724254202
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
docker.io/library/hello-world:latest                                       
```

We just pulled our first docker image from the Docker Hub.

### Docker Commands

Now let's get to know some Docker commands;

#### docker create
Creates a container from an image.

```
 docker create hello-world
```
Result:
```
fa622c1b5eec67139c97a0c0db2a0b306012c504ddfdf53eee7b0c143945667a
```
NOTE: When a container is created, it is given a unique ID.

#### docker ps
Lists running containers, optional -a flag to list all containers.
```
 docker ps -a
```
Result:
```

```

#### docker start
This command starts any stopped container(s).
```
docker start fa622
```
We need the container ID to start the container

#### docker stop
This command stops any running container(s).
```
 docker stop fa622
```

####  docker run
This command creates the container first, and then it starts the container. This command combines the docker create and the docker start command.

```
docker run ubuntu /bin/echo 'Hello world'
```
Result:
```

#### docker images
This command lists out all the Docker Images.

```
 docker image ls

```

#### docker container rm
This command deletes container(s).

```
 docker container rm 1a203a1e19a2
```
*NOTE: The containers have to be in a stopped state in order to be deleted*.

#### docker image rm
This command deletes image(s). To remove a docker image, you will need the ID of the image. Use the `docker images ls` command to get the ID.
```
 docker image rm fce289e99eb9
```
*NOTE: To remove the image, remove the container first.*

You can also get help using the command below:

```
docker --help
```

Result:

```

### Writing Your First Dockerfile

Dockerfile is the text file that will contain the directives on how to build your docker image. Below are some Dockerfile instructions that you should know:

- FROM — set the base image
- RUN — execute a command in the container
- COPY — supports the basic copying of local files into the container
- ENV — set environment variable
- WORKDIR — set the working directory
- ENTRYPOINT — set the image’s main command, allowing that image to be run as though it was that command
- VOLUME — create mount-point for a volume
- CMD — set executable for container

For example, let's see what a Dockerfile for a Go application could look like:
```
FROM golang:1.11-alpine

WORKDIR /go/src/app
COPY . .

RUN go get -d -v ./...
RUN go install -v ./...

CMD ["app"]
```

*Be sure to always indicate a specific version of the base image you would like to use because you never know when the ‘Latest’ image will be changed*.

You can then build and run the Docker image:

```
 docker build -t my-golang-app
```

This command will create an image tagged `my-goland-app` from your Dockerfile

```
 docker run -it --name my-running-app my-golang-app
```
With this, the container/image is production ready.

### Conclusion
Docker is a strong tool for creating and running applications both locally and in production. Numerous CI/CD tools like Jenkins, TravisCI, CircleCI, etc. are now fully supported and integrated with Docker, which makes your changes from environment to environment very easy. This tutorial has just scratched the basic part of the Docker world. Below are some a few resources to help get you out.
