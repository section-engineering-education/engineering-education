## Anatomy of an article

- Every article has its own directory
- Every article's copy lives at `$article_directory/index.md`
- Every article's hero image lives at `$article_directory/hero.jpg`
- Any additional images live in the article directory

The whole structure looks like this:

```
working-with-databases-part1/
├── index.md
├── hero.jpg
└── mongodb.png
```
