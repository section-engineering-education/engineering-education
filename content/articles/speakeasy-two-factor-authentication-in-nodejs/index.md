Two-factor authentication is a security measure implemented in an application to increase security by providing two separate pieces of evidences for authorization to the system. Two-factor authentication (2FA) works beyond username/email and password authentication.
<!--more-->
In this tutorial, we will learn to authenticate by using the Speakeasy library. We’ll also learn to do a backend implementation of two-factor authentication using a token generated by the Google Authenticator app.

### Introduction
One of the ways through which 2FA is implemented is using the speakeasy library.

The Speakeasy library provides two-factor authentication using a One-Time Password (OTP). The library provides an additional layer of security to an application's standard authentication process.

Using the OTP, Speakeasy provides extra data required for account access.

You can find more about the library [here](https://github.com/speakeasyjs/speakeasy).

### Setting up the Node.js application
Let's begin by initializing our application using the `init` command.

```bash
npm init -y
```

The command will create a `package.json` file, that holds the metadata about the project.

```json
{
  "name": "node-two-factor-auth",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "nodemon start"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "mia-roberts",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "node-json-db": "^1.3.0",
    "speakeasy": "^2.0.0",
    "uuid": "^8.3.2"
  }
}
```

### Installing the dependencies
After the setup, our application needs some project-specific dependencies.

The dependencies include:
- `express` as the backend server.
- `uuid` to generate universal unique user-id.
- `node-json-db` as our database to store the data as JSON.
- `speakeasy` library for authentication
- `nodemon` to use as our development dependency.

With `nodemon`, we won't have to restart our application every time we make a change.

```bash
npm install –-save express, nodemon, speakeasy, uuid, node-json-db
```

### Setting up the application
First, we will set up our server.

Our server will run on the application's entry point `index.js` file.

So, we add the block of code below under the `index` file:

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000

app.use(express.json())
```

After setting up the server, we bring in our dependencies into the `index.js` file.

The `uuid` will create a unique user id, while the `node-json-db` will serve as the database to store the `user-id` and the `secret` associated with that user-id.

```js
//adding the speakeasy library
const speakeasy = require('speakeasy')

//adding the uuid dependacy
const uuid = require('uuid')

//adding node-json-db
const { JsonDB } = require('node-json-db')
const { Config } = require('node-json-db/dist/lib/JsonDBConfig')
```

### The node JSON database
Our application will use the `node-json-db` module to store user records in JSON format.

Check out [this link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-json-db?S_TACT=AGRAK616) to find more about `node-json-db`.

As mentioned in the documentation of `node-json-db`, to initialize the `node-json-db`, we will add the script below:

```js
// instance of the node-json-db
const db = new JsonDB(new Config("DataBase", true, false, '/'));
```

- `new Config()` - creates a `node-json-db` database config.
- `DataBase` - specifies the name of the JSON storage file.
- `true` - tells the database to save on each push.
- `false` - instructs the database to save the database in a human-readable format.
- `/` - the separator to use when accessing our database values.

### Sending requests using Postman
Since our application does not have a frontend, we will use Postman when sending the requests to the applications' backend.

Postman provides an interface for handling requests that would have otherwise been handled by the `HTML`.

Check out [this guide](https://www.blazemeter.com/blog/how-use-postman-manage-and-execute-your-apis) on how to use Postman.

You can download Postman using [this](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) link.

In `postman`, we will use three routes, `/register`, `/verify` and `/validate` route.

Now we will create the URLs as below:
- Register: `http://localhost:5000/api/register`
- Verify: `http://localhost:5000/api/verify`
- Validate: `http://localhost:5000/api/validate`

### Registering users
In this application, we assume that a user is authenticated using his/her `user-id`. Therefore, we ignore other user identification details.

We will register users and store their `user-id` alongside the `secret-key` generated by speakeasy in the `Database.json` file.

The registration process begins by passing a `POST` request to the `/register` route in the `index.js` file.

We then use `uuid` to generate a unique `user-id` and generate a temporary `secret-key` for the user ID.

Next, we store the `user-id` and the `secret-key` in the `node-json-db`.

The code for the process is as below:

```js
app.post('/api/register', (request, response) =>{
    const userid = uuid.v4()
    try {
        const path = `user/${userid }` 
        const temp_secret = speakeasy.generateSecret()
        db.push(path,{ userid , temp_secret }) 
        // we only need the base32 
        response.json({userid , secret: temp_secret.base32})
    }catch (error) {
        console.log(error)
        response.status(500).json({message: 'Error generating the secret'})
    }
})
```

The user object in the database will be as shown below:

```json
{
    "user":{
        "00e296df-cff6-44ee-94f7-763de86962c3":{
            "id":"00e296df-cff6-44ee-94f7-763de86962c3",
            "temp_secret":{
                "ascii":"eez>9svVgNa$DE9TXZQw#z0dkXI!GSQT",
                "hex":"65657a3e39737656674e612444453954585a5177237a30646b58492147535154",
                "base32":"MVSXUPRZON3FMZ2OMESEIRJZKRMFUULXEN5DAZDLLBESCR2TKFKA",
                "otpauth_url":"otpauth://totp/SecretKey?secret=MVSXUPRZON3FMZ2OMESEIRJZKRMFUULXEN5DAZDLLBESCR2TKFKA"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Verifying the user
Next, we need to verify our registered users using their `user-id` and `temp-secret`. We also need to set the `secret` permanently into the database.

#### Retrieving id and temp secret from the database
Since we will need the `user-id` and `temp secret`, we extract them from the database using the code below:

```js
// Retrieve user from the database
const path = `/user/${userId}`;
const user = db.getData(path);

//destructure the base-32 of the temp=secret
const { base32: secret } = user.temp_secret;
```

#### Generating verification token
Next, we use the `temp-secret` from above to generate a `verification token` using the authenticator app.

Navigate to `Chrome`, under `Extensions`, download the authenticator.

We will use the authenticator to generate verification tokens for our users.

You can follow [this link](https://docs.zivver.com/en/user/webapp/references/2fa-setup-with-chrome-authenticator.html) to learn more about generating authentication tokens with an authenticator application.

The authenticator will generate a code that we will supply to the JSON body of the verify-route using Postman.

#### Sending post request for verification response via Postman
In Postman, we will create a new route `/verify` for verification, where we enter the `user-id` and the `token`.

Next, on the `body` section of the Postman, use the JSON data to send the `user-id` retrieved and the associated  `token` generated by the authenticator application as shown below:

```json
{
  "userId": "ed48c14e-cb85-4575-830c-c534d142f8e4",
  "token":"127381"
}
```

The application's `/verify` route will extract the `token` and `user-id` from the `body` using the block of code below:

```js
const {token, userId} = req.body; 
```

Next, we will call the `/verify` function of the speakeasy to verify the user by checking the `token` against the `temp-secret`.

The function returns `true`, if the `token` is successfully verified. On returning `true`, we update the `temp-secret` to a `permanent-secret` in the database.

We implement this as shown below:

```js
const verified = speakeasy.totp.verify({
  secret,
  encoding: 'base32',
  token
});

if (verified) {
  // Update the temporary secret to a permanent secret
  db.push(path, { id: userId, secret: user.temp_secret });
  res.json({ verified: true })
} else {
  res.json({ verified: false})
}
```

### Validate the token
We need to continuously validate tokens from the authenticator.

We will create a new route called `/validate`. The route will have the same code, except for a time window after which the token is validated.

Additionally, we won't change the `temp-secret` in this phase.

The code is below:

```js
  //Validate the token
  app.post('/api/validate', (req,res) => {
    const {token, userId} = req.body;   
    try {
      // Retrieve user from database
      const path = `/user/${userId}`;
      const user = db.getData(path);
    
      const { base32: secret } = user.secret;
      const tokenValidate = speakeasy.totp.verify({
        secret,
        encoding: 'base32',
        token, 
        window:1 // time window
      });
    
      if (tokenValidate) {
        
        res.json({ validated: true })
      } else {
        res.json({ validated: false})
      }
    }catch(error) {
      console.error(error)
      res.status(500).json({ message: "Error retrieving user!"})
    };
  })
```

To check if a user is validated, we will navigate to the `/validate` in Postman, and supply the `user-id` and `token`.

### Running the server
To test out the application, we add the block of code below in the `index.js` file.

To run the server, use `npm start`.

```js
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000
app.listen(PORT, () =>{
    console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
})
```

*Route for validation*

### Conclusion
We set up a Node.js application and coded a backend for two-factor authentication using Speakeasy. We also learned how to use the authenticator extension in chrome for generation tokens. 

Finally, we used Postman to simulate sending requests from the front end of an application.

Check the links in the section below for more information about the topic.

You can find the code for implementation [here](https://replit.com/@miaroberts1/nodejs-2FA-using-speakeasy).

However, you'll have to download the source code and install Postman for testing.

Happy coding!
