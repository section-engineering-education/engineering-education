Many scholars have defined sentiment analysis; hardly there exists a new definition for the term that has not been heard of before. On that note, I will say sentiment analysis is the systematic method of extracting emotions with machine learning. This tutorial will show how to implement sentiment analysis using naive Bayes algorithms.

Sentiment analysis has been helpful in many fields, in discovering hate speech, analyzing public opinion about a product or brand, building chatbots, etc.

### Prerequisites

First and foremost, we want to build a sentiment analysis project using `Bayesian models` and discover which of its algorithms is best. Also, it is not a work of which algorithm is best for sentiment analysis, but rather, which of the `naive Bayes algorithms` is best for this project. I firmly believe my readers are machine learning students who are expected to be versed in basic Python programming and must be good at performing data analysis with [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Numpy](https://numpy.org/).

### Goal

At the end of this tutorial, readers should be able to:

- understand how sentiment analysis works,

- build a supervised machine learning model that predicts the sentiments of a word or sentence given to it,

- determine which is better between count vectorizer and tfidf vectorizer,

- compare the naive Bayes model that is best for text classification, and

- use Pandas functions for data analysis.




### Why Naive Bayes Models?.

The Bayesian theorem is the core principle behind Naive Bayes algorithms. It assumes that all features are independent of one another. Thus, we can as well say that the classifier believes that one particular attribute in a class does not influence the presence of another. 
We can take, for example, a cucumber. It is green, long, and has a straight shape. The classifier assumes that being green or long or straight in shape are independent attributes and contribute to the existence of a cucumber.

Talking about efficient algorithms for text classification tasks, we can always call on the `Naive Bayes classifiers`. They are simple and very fast classifiers yet powerful. But, of course, there is a huge probability that if you use some other classification algorithms on sentiment analysis, you will arrive at better results than any result we might have gotten here. Still, for this project, we are sticking to the Naive Bayes algorithms.

### IMDB movie review dataset

An IMDB movie review dataset with 25000 training data and 25000 testing data is used for this tutorial. It was downloaded from the Stanford archive, and its data is somewhat complicated because it is compressed. To know more about this dataset and download it, kindly visit [IMDB Movie Review Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz). Therefore, a function was written to be able to read it into our notebooks. 

### Installing necessary libraries

Most importantly, we need to import every library needed for this project. Any library used in the notebook has been `pip install` by me. There are thousands of libraries except for the standard `Numpy` and `Pandas`. For a start, there is a need to at least install `sklearn` and `nltk`, which are very important libraries for text classifications amidst many others. 

```python
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install sklearn
pip install nltk
```

### Function to process the IMDB datasets

As mentioned earlier, due to the complexity of the dataset, we have to write a function that reads it into our notebook. 
With the function below, the dataset will be uncompressed and cleaned for use with the function `clean_text`, which will replace all characters with capital letters to small letters, remove all the punctuations and lemmatize the words. Lemmatization is the process of stemming or categorizing words into their root forms, e.g. words like `wake, woke, woken, waking` will all be categorized with `wake`, which is the root word.

Create a `utils.py` file and put the following inside.

Categorical and Gaussian naive Bayes models keep flagging errors because they can't take the samples of data provided all at once for some reason which might be due to memory allocation. Therefore, a separate function was written for the two to take in data samples in a particular size per batch.

```python
class CategoricalBatchNB(TransformerMixin):
 def __init__(self, batch_size, classes, *args, **kwargs):
        self._batch_size = batch_size

            self._model.partial_fit(
                x[index - batch_size:index, :].toarray(),
                y[index - batch_size:index],

            )
 return self

 @staticmethod
 def transform(x, y=None, **fit_params):

 def predict(self, x):
        batch_size = self._batch_size
        predictions = []
 for index in tqdm(range(batch_size, x.shape[0] + batch_size, batch_size)):
            predictions.extend(

### Preparing the notebook for BernoulliNB

Our main notebook should have some standard imports from libraries and packages installed.

```python
from collections import Counter

import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 

from tqdm.notebook import tqdm
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline 
from sklearn.naive_bayes import BernoulliNB
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold 
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics import (
    classification_report, confusion_matrix, 
    f1_score as calculate_f1_score, accuracy_score as calculate_accuracy_score
)
```
We are importing the necessary functions from `utils.py`.

```python
from utils import CleanTextTransformer,load_imdb_sentiment_analysis_dataset
```
Load the data

```python
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = load_imdb_sentiment_analysis_dataset(imdb_data_path='aclImdb')
```
Visualize the data size

```python

keys, values, labels = [], [], []
count = Counter(y_train)

for key, value in count.items():
    keys.append(key)
    values.append(value)
    labels.append("positive" if value else "negative")

print(count)
print()

barlist = plt.bar(keys, values)

plt.title("Frequency of Sentiments")
plt.xticks(keys, labels)
plt.ylabel('Number of Reviews')
plt.xlabel('Sentiment expressed in Reviews')

barlist[0].set_color('red')
barlist[1].set_color('green')

plt.show()
```

#### What is vectorization?

Vectorization is an essential part of feature engineering as it’s a way of converting a collection of text documents to a vector of term/token counts. It ensures text data are ​pre-processed before generating the vector representations. The two key vectorizers we used and compared are CountVectorizer and TfIdf (term frequency, inverse document frequency)

#### Using Countvectorizer in our pipeline

```python
pipeNB = Pipeline([
    ("clean_text", CleanTextTransformer()),
    ('count', CountVectorizer(stop_words="english")),
    ('classifier', BernoulliNB())
])
```
We hence fit the model in the created pipeline
```python
pipeNB.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
![fitting the data](/engineering-education/sentiment-analysis-with-naive-bayes-algorithms/fit_bernoulli.PNG)

#### Model evaluation

Question: “What’s the essence of evaluating a model?”

Answer: “It’s like asking why test a student after a year of study, how do you judge his performance, Understanding, and Assimilation?”

If you get a job as a Machine Learning Engineer in a company where you have to build varieties of models, and you feel like evaluation is unnecessary because you are so sure of your model, prepare to wake up jobless one day. No model is perfect models can misbehave. However, some metrics have been put in place to help us understand our models better. 
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix

Evaluate fitted model
```python
y_pred = pipeNB.predict(X_test)

print("Classification Report")
print("==================================")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```
![classification report](/engineering-education/sentiment-analysis-with-naive-bayes-algorithms/bernoulli_class_report.PNG)

Evaluation should answer these questions for you.
- How efficient is my model? Is it useful?
- Will introducing more data improve its performance?
- Do I introduce more features?

On predicting with our models, we printed out the classification report. Let’s briefly explain what each metric stands for: 

`Precision` is how straight to point your model is. For the negative sentiments, precision will be something like - out of all predictions, how many are negatives? - That’s 78% for the model in the picture. For the positive sentiments, out of all predictions, how many are positives? That’s 87%.

`Recall` is how much you trust the precision. For the negative sentiments, the recall will be - out of all actual negatives, how many the model predicted correctly as negative. According to the model in our picture, it is 89%, and the positive is 75%.

F1-Score can be stated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Simple
![f1score](/engineering-education/sentiment-analysis-with-naive-bayes-algorithms/f1score.PNG)

Accuracy 
Accuracy is defined as the percentage of correct predictions for the test data. It can be gotten by dividing the number of correct predictions by the number of total predictions.

`Accuracy = (correct predictions / all predictions)`

```python
print("Confusion Matrix")
print("===================================")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
```
![confusion matrix](/engineering-education/sentiment-analysis-with-naive-bayes-algorithms/confusion_matrix_b.PNG)

#### Confusion matrix

The confusion matrix, which can also be called an error matrix, is a table layout that allows the visualization of the performance of an algorithm. It consists of:

- True positives: Predicting an observation belongs to a class, and it does belong to that class.
- True negatives: Predicting an observation does not belong to a class, and it does not belong to that class.
- False positives: Predicting an observation belongs to a class, but it does not.
- False negatives: Predicting an observation does not belong to a class, but it does.

#### Performing cross-validation

```python
accuracy, f1_score = [], []
skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=10, shuffle=True, random_state=100) 

for train_index, test_index in tqdm(skf.split(X_train, y_train), total=10):
    X_train_fold, X_test_fold = X_train[train_index], X_train[test_index] 
    y_train_fold, y_test_fold = y_train[train_index], y_train[test_index]

    pipeNB.fit(X_train_fold, y_train_fold)
    y_pred = pipeNB.predict(X_test_fold)
 
    accuracy.append(calculate_accuracy_score(y_test_fold, y_pred))
    f1_score.append(calculate_f1_score(y_test_fold, y_pred))

# make as array
f1_score = np.array(f1_score)
accuracy = np.array(accuracy)

print('\nModel Metrics ==> ')
print("================================================")
print(f'{"descr":5s} | {"accuracy":^10s} | {"f1_score":^10s}')
print("================================================")
print(f'{"Max":5s} | {accuracy.max():^10.2f} | {f1_score.max():^10.2f}') 
print(f'{"Min":5s} | {accuracy.min():^10.2f} | {f1_score.min():^10.2f}') 
print(f'{"Mean":5s} | {accuracy.mean():^10.2f} | {f1_score.mean():^10.2f}')
```
![cross validation](/engineering-education/sentiment-analysis-with-naive-bayes-algorithms/bernoulli_cv.PNG)

There are different libraries for cross-validation, and we've employed `StratifiedKFold` for this tutorial. The essence is to be sure our model is fit and not biased. What cross-validation does is switch between the train and test data. It takes in the whole fresh dataset, does its splitting according to the number specified, and shuffles the train and test dataset one at a time, like the form of
Train 1-9, test 10
Train 1-10(exclude 9),  test 9 
Train 2-10, test 1
On and on until it goes round.



#### Using Tfidfvectorizer in the pipeline

```python
pipeNB = Pipeline([
    ("clean_text", CleanTextTransformer()),
    ('tfidf', TfidfVectorizer(stop_words="english")),
    ('classifier', BernoulliNB())
])
```
Fitting the data into the pipeline
```python
pipeNB.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Conclusion

Even though complement and multinomial seem to have a tie in their scores, I will stick to the fact that complement is the best naive Bayes algorithm for text classification. The reason for choosing the complement model is that it has been used on numerous datasets before this, the complement model has been doing well across the board.

Therefore, we can all agree that complementNB is the best naive Bayes algorithm for sentiment analysis. 

To get the best grip of everything, check out [my Github repo:](https://github.com/wizardcalidad/sentiment-analsis-imdb)

On a final note, machine learning is not all about building models for predictions and classification. It is about figuring out how machines can learn from experience to solve significant problems. Building a system to help billions of people solve everyday problems gives you an incredible feeling of satisfaction. So go out there, develop an idea, train it, test it thoroughly, and make the world a better place.
