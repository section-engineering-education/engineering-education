Daraja API is an Application Programming Interface that creates a bridge for payment integration to web and mobile apps. In your web app, you can create a button that when a user clicks, they can initiate payment.
<!--more-->
For example, a web application provides a button that the user clicks to send a request to Safaricom Daraja; upon receiving the request, Daraja sends an STK push which contains the amount to be deducted from the Mpesa wallet.

The user is then prompted to enter their PIN. Once the user enters the PIN, the transaction is processed immediately.

### Prerequisites
To follow this tutorial, you should:
- Have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and PHP.
- Have a local development environment setup.

#### Goals
- Understand how to create an account in the Safaricom Daraja API portal and obtain the credentials for authentication.
- How to integrate Daraja API with PHP.

### Step 1 - Creating a Safaricom Daraja Account
To create an account in Safaricom Daraja, open the [Safaricom Developer Portal](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/).

### Step 2 - Creating a new app in Safaricom Daraja
After creating an account, login and create a new app, give it a name of your choice.

Take note of the `CONSUMER KEY`, `CONSUMER SECRET`, and `Lipa na Mpesa pass key` obtained through the app simulation created because we will use them later.

### Step 3 - We simulate our new app to obtain lipa na mpesa pass key
To simulate the app, click on APIS, which is on the menu bar and choose the simulation of the customer to business order.

We then need to select the app that we created and start simulating to obtain the passkeys and business shortcode.

### Step 4 - Creating our project
Open your code editor, create a new folder (give it a name of your choice), and define a new PHP file named `index.php`.

### Step 5 - Designing the user interface
In this step, we design an interface that will prompt the user to enter their phone number; which they will use to make payments.

The phone number entered should be a Safaricom number which has the amount the user wants to pay.

> Note: If the user enters the number which does not have enough balance in mpesa, it will not display the STK Push. Also, the phone number should start with a country code like `254727392XXXX`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
      <title>Form </title>
   </head>
   <style >
      body{
      background-color: skyblue;
      }
   </style>
   <body>
      <center>
         <form style="padding-top: 150px;" action="MpesaTest.php" method="POST">
            <fieldset style="width: 400px; height: 300px; background-color: white;">
               <label style="padding-top: 200px;color:red;">Lipa Online</label>
               <br>
               <input class="input2" type="number" name="amount" placeholder="Enter Amount" style="margin-top: 60px;">
               <br><br>
               <input type="number" type="number" name="phone_number" placeholder="enter Phone number">
               <br><br>
               <button class="button" style="color: white; background-color: blue;">
               Make Payment Now
               </button>
            </fieldset>
         </form>
      </center>
      </div>
   </body>
</html>
```

Your output should be something similar to this:

### Step 6 - Writing our M-Pesa logic
Define a new file and name it `MpesaTest.php`. This is where we define our logic to implement the STK Push on the users' phones.

This code will use the credentials we obtained from creating the Safaricom Daraja App.

#### Variables declaration
Inside the file we created previously, declare and initialize the following variables using the credentials obtained from the app you created in Safaricom Daraja:

```php
<?php
// Initialize the variables
$consumer_key = 'Lms5EIf2gK16o1sptYPaA3HsfbGUd7fv';
$consumer_secret = 'dgfk1IefQx1SnG1A';
$Business_Code = '174379';
$Passkey = 'bfb279f9aa9bdbcf158e97dd71a467cd2e0c893059b10f78e6b72ada1ed2c919';
$Type_of_Transaction = 'CustomerPayBillOnline';
$Token_URL = 'https://sandbox.safaricom.co.ke/oauth/v1/generate?grant_type=client_credentials';
$phone_number = $_POST['phone_number'];
$OnlinePayment = 'https://sandbox.safaricom.co.ke/mpesa/stkpush/v1/processrequest';
$total_amount = $_POST['amount'];
$CallBackURL = 'https://2f50f430.ngrok.io/callback.php?key=your password';
$Time_Stamp = date("Ymdhis");
$password = base64_encode($Business_Code . $Passkey . $Time_Stamp);
?>
```

In the script above:
- `consumer_key` - This variable assists the developer to access Safaricom API.
- `consumer_secret` - This variable also assists the developer to access Safaricom API.
- `Business_Code` - Is a business code that receives payment when the customer enters their Mpesa PIN
- `Passkey` - After creating the Daraja App, you will get a passkey.
- `Type_of_Transaction` - Type of transaction to be made.
- `Token_URL` - Authenticate and return the API token used for accessing Lipa Na Mpesa services in Safaricom Daraja
- `phone_number` - The Safaricom number you will use to make payments.
- `OnlinePayment` - For the test environment, pass the Safaricom STK processing request.
- `total_amount` - The total amount to be deducted from your account after entering your Mpesa Pin.
- `CallBackURL` - URL used to receive notifications from Mpesa API.
- `Time_Stamp` - Time of transaction. It is usually in the format (YYYY-MM-DD).
- `password` - Unique password, which is used for encrypting the request.

#### Generating authentication token
Next, get an authentication token that will enable us to access and interact with services provided by Safaricom Mpesa:

```php
//generate authentication token.
<?php
$curl_Tranfer = curl_init();
curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer, CURLOPT_URL, $Token_URL);
$credentials = base64_encode($consumer_key . ':' . $consumer_secret);
curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array('Authorization: Basic ' . $credentials));
curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer, CURLOPT_HEADER, false);
curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false);
$curl_Tranfer_response = curl_exec($curl_Tranfer);

$token = json_decode($curl_Tranfer_response)->access_token;
```

In the script above;
- `curl_init()` - The method creates a new session and returns a cURL handle; which will be stored in the variable named `$curl_transfer`.
- `curl_setopt` â€” Create a cURL transfer option.
- `CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER` - We set it to true(1) instead of immediately displaying the transfer, return it as a string of the curl exec() return value.
- `CURLOPT_HEADER` - set it to false to prevent the inclusion of the header in the output.
- `curl_exec` - Obtain the URL and send it to the browser.
- `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` - We set the option false so that the peer certificate verification succeeds.
- `json_decode` is a function that converts a JSON string to a JSON object.

#### Initiating the STK push on the users' phone
Next, we will implement a code to initiate the STK push on the user's phone.

We define a variable ` data2_string` to use json_encode on our request parameters. Then we define a variable named `curl2_response` to execute our curl request:

```php
$curl_Tranfer2 = curl_init();
curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer2, CURLOPT_URL, $OnlinePayment);
curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer2, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array('Content-Type:application/json', 'Authorization:Bearer ' . $token));

$curl_Tranfer2_post_data = [
    'BusinessShortCode' => $Business_Code,
    'Password' => $password,
    'Timestamp' =>$Time_Stamp,
    'TransactionType' =>$Type_of_Transaction,
    'Amount' => $total_amount,
    'PartyA' => $phone_number,
    'PartyB' => $Business_Code,
    'PhoneNumber' => $phone_number,
    'CallBackURL' => $CallBackURL,
    'AccountReference' => 'Hillary',
    'TransactionDesc' => 'Test',
];

$data2_string = json_encode($curl_Tranfer2_post_data);

curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer2, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer2, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer2, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $data2_string);
curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer2, CURLOPT_HEADER, false);
curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer2, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, 0);
curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer2, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, 0);
$curl_Tranfer2_response = json_decode(curl_exec($curl_Tranfer2));

echo json_encode($curl_Tranfer2_response, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);
?>
```

In the script above:
- `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` - This option determines whether the curl verifies the authenticity of the peer's certificate.
- `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` - Set to zero for connection to succeed regardless of the names in the certificate. To ensure that the SSL peer certificates `Common Name` or `Subject Alternate Name` field matches the given hostname.
- `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` - Data to POST to server. If you pass a string, int, float, or bool as an input value, JSON encode() will generate a JSON that is a basic value (not an object or an array).
- `json_decode` - a function that converts a JSON string to a JSON object.
- `json_encode` - The JSON representation of the specified value is returned as a string.

### Create a form that will contain a button to confirm payment

```php
<form class="contact2-form validate-form" action="#" method="post">
   <input type="hidden" name="Check_request_ID" value="<?php echo $curl_Tranfer2_response->Check_request_ID ?>">
   </br></br>
   <button class="contact2-form-btn" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Confirm Payment is Complete</button>
</form>
```

Output:

### Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have learned how to create an account in Safaricom Daraja API. We have also learned how to create an App and obtain the credentials in the newly created app.

We have also learned how to integrate Safaricom Mpesa STK push, where a user is prompted to enter their phone number and the amount they want to pay. This sends an STK push in their phone number so they can enter their Mpesa Pin to make the payment.
