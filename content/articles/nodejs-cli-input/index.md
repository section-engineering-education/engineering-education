In this tutorial, we will learn how to get user input in a Node.js CLI application. To do this, you will need to listen to `STDIN` (Standard Input), which Node.js exposes as `process.stdin`, a readable stream.

Streams are used to deal with I/O. You can learn more about it in this [documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html).

### Prerequisites
- You should have an understanding of the JavaScript language.

- You should have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer.

### Overview
1. [Project Setup](#project-setup)
2. [Readline Package](#readline-package)
3. [Callback Hell](#callback-hell)
4. [Async Iterator](#async-iterator)
5. [Readline Sync Package](#readline-sync-package)
6. [Recap](#lets-recap)

### Project setup
To get started, letâ€™s set up our project.

Create a new directory called `node-cli-input`. 

Inside the directory, run:
```bash
npm init -y
```

This will generate a `package.json` file.

Once that's done, create a new file called `index.js` to write our code.

### Readline package
The `readline` package is a built-in package in Node.js. `readline` is a wrapper around the standard I/O.

Let's import the `readline` package into our `index.js` file. 

```JavaScript
const readline = require('readline');
```

We should create a new `readline` interface object using the `readline.createInterface()` method and configure the readable and writable streams. Let's set the input and output streams to `process.stdin` and `process.stdout` respectively.

```JavaScript
const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});
```

We can ask a question to the user using the `rl.question()` method. 

The `rl.question()` method takes 2 arguments:
- **String**: This string will be displayed as the question to the user.

- **Callback function**: The `rl.question()` method will wait until the user provides input. Once the user provides input, this callback function will be executed. The callback function will get the user's input as an argument.

> NOTE: We should close the streams using the `rl.close()` method inside the callback function. If not closed, the process will remain in an idle state.

For example:

```JavaScript
rl.question("Your favorite color? ", (input) => {
  console.log(input);
  rl.close();
});
```

Output:

```bash
Your favorite color? Black
Black
```

You can add an event listener for the `close` streams event using the `rl.on()` method.

```JavaScript
rl.on('close', () => {
  console.log('Streams Closed')
})
```

Output:

```bash
Your favorite color? Black
Black
Streams Closed
```

You can learn more about the `readline` package from it's [documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html).

### Callback hell
The problem with the `rl.question()` method is, it doesn't return a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). Thus, we can't use [async/await](https://javascript.info/async-await) to pause the flow of the program until the user provides the input.

If you want to get multiple user inputs in sequence, you have to do it within a callback function, like this:

```JavaScript
rl.question("Question 1? ", (answer1) => {
  // do stuff

  rl.question("Question 2? ", (answer2) => {
    // do stuff

    rl.question("Question 3? ", (answer3) => {
      // do stuff

      rl.question("Question 4? ", (answer4) => {
        console.log(answer1, answer2, answer3, answer4);
        rl.close();
      });
    });
  });
});
```

As you can see, this can quickly get out of control and the code will be hard to manage.

### Async iterator
Asynchronous iteration allows us to iterate over data that comes asynchronously, on-demand. You can create an async iterator that iterates through each line in the input stream.

If you'd like to learn more about Async iterators, refer to this [article](https://blog.risingstack.com/async-iterators-in-node-js/). 

```JavaScript
for await (const line of rl) {
  // Each line in from the input stream will be available successively here as `line`.
}
```

We can't use the `await` keyword outside of an `async` function. So, we need to wrap all of our code inside an async function.

```JavaScript
async function main() {
  // do your stuff here

  for await (const line of rl) {
    // Each line in from the input stream will be available here as `line`.
  }
}

main();
```

Let's create a new function called `input()` to prompt the user and get input.

We can use the [Symbol.asyncIterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/asyncIterator) of the `readline` object to get the next value in the input stream.

```JavaScript
async function input(prompt) {
  console.log(prompt);
  return (await rl[Symbol.asyncIterator]().next()).value;
}
```

Now, we can use this function to get the value from the input stream and use the `await` keyword to pause the execution until we get the input from the user.

```JavaScript
async function main() {
  const name = await input("May I have your name? ");
  const color = await input("Your favorite color? ");

  console.log(name, color);
  rl.close();
}

main();
```

### Readline sync package
If you don't mind installing an external package, that will increase the bundle size of the CLI application you are building, you can use the `readline-sync` package to get the input from the user in a synchronous manner.

Let's install the `readline-sync` by running:

```bash
npm install readline-sync
```

Now, let's import the package.

```JavaScript
const readlineSync = require("readline-sync");
```

Similar to the `readline` package, you can use the `readlineSync.question()` method to prompt the user for input.

Unlike the `readline` package, you don't have to pass a callback function to this function. The `readlineSync.question()` method will return the user's input.

```JavaScript
let input = readlineSync.question('May I have your name? ');
console.log(`Hi ${input}!`);
```

The `readlineSync` package also has other functions like `readlineSync.keyInYN()`, `readlineSync.keyInSelect()`, etc.

The `readlineSync.keyInYN()` is used to get the user's response from a single key without pressing the *Enter* key. The function will return `true` if **"Y"** was pressed or `false` if something else was pressed.

```JavaScript
if (readlineSync.keyInYN('Yes?')) {
  // 'Y' key was pressed.
} else {
  // Another key was pressed.
}
```

The `readlineSync.keyInSelect()` is used to prompt a user to choose an item from a list. The function will return the number the user selected. The user doesn't have to press the *Enter* button when we use this function.

```JavaScript
let colors = ['Black', 'White', 'Gray', 'Yellow', 'Blue'];

let index = readlineSync.keyInSelect(colors, 'Favorite Color?');
console.log(colors[index]);
```

Output:

```bash
[1] Black
[2] White
[3] Gray
[4] Yellow
[5] Blue
[0] CANCEL
 
Favorite Color? [1...5 / 0]: 2
White
```

You can learn more about the `readline-sync` package and the other methods that are available from it's [npm page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/readline-sync).

### Let's recap
1. We used the `readline` package to prompt input from the user.

2. We added an event listener for the readline stream's `close` event.

3. We used the async iterator to write an async function to get the input from the user to prevent callback hell.

4. We used the `readline-sync` package to prompt input from the user synchronously.

Congratulations, :partying_face: You did it.

Thanks for reading!
