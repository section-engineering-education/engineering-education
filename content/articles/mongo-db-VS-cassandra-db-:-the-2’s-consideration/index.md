A `database` is a system designed to store and process data records or files that contain information, such as sales transactions, product information, customer data, and business financial(s), ensuring easy access, management, and updating of records by the database user. A database serves as the building block for a more robust framework known as Database Management System (DBMS). According to Techopedia, Database Management System (DBMS) is a system designed to define, manipulate, retrieve and manage data in a database and interact with the end-user, back-end, and the application itself to produce information required in a timely and efficient manner. 

In today's business space, We can not overemphasize the need for an architecture capable of managing, processing, and storing corporate data or client information in a fast and secure manner. Businesses are now migrating from the traditional vehicles of data management which was overwhelmed with several issues and restrictions, to a more systematic and automated vehicle for data processing known as Database Management System (DBMS). The ever-increasing need for an effective, efficient, and work-specific data management tool represents an enormous challenge for businesses today. They now have to decide between self-designing a DBMS and adopting a pre-set commercial DBMS.

This article sheds light on MongoDb and CassandraDB, their features/characteristics, qualities, and how they compete in the area of database speed and security.

### MongoDB AND CassandraDB

#### MongoDB

Dwight Merriman and Eliot Horowitz designed them in 2007 as a solution to the series of issues faced while using traditional relational databases to Develop Web applications. `MongoDB` is a NoSQL database management program principally used for managing document-oriented information and storing or retrieving such data. It aids the development of highly available and scalable internet applications. It uses records made up of documents that contain a data structure composed of fields similar to the columns in a relational database and value pairs (a variety of data types arrays of documents).

#### CassandraDB

Like MongoDB, Cassandra DB is an open-source, distributed, vast column store NoSQL database management program designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. Developed initially in 2008, it is a part of the Apache community product line designed to be free, highly editable, and capable of processing a large amount of structured and unstructured data across numerous servers. It is worth noting that CassandraDB excels at storing time-series data (where old data does not need to be updated) and is proficient at seamlessly responding to data with a high number of queries having similar partition keys.

### Characteristics and features
MongoDB and CassandraDB are from the Non-Structured Query Language family (NoSQL), a new database form. They promote simpler designs and faster processing and structure consistency, thereby differentiating it from the relational/traditional database systems, which were known to handle data storage and retrieval in a relational/tabular manner. They support real-time analytics and optimized data handling. It results from their ability to process data almost entirely through RAM. Thus, differing from traditional databases, which process data from the hard disk. They can also store any data and reduce data queue time through their robust replication features, allowing users to create any number of fields in a document.

Finally, both MongoDB and CassandraDB are free, open-source software that allows users to configure them at no expense. They both assist people in the open community to utilize them to manage data. They also serve as a building block for other features/databases to develop a robust data system.

### The speed vs. security nexus
In today's highly competitive business pressures companies to sell to both current and potential customers two notions which are "we prioritize you first" (synonymous to speed) and "you can trust us" (synonymous to security). Businesses now have the responsibility to find a tool capable of solving the problems mentioned above in their relations with customers.

For years now, businesses and experts have offered different views and preferences regarding which of the two problems (Speed and Security) organizations should allocate more resources regarding the procurement of a database capable of meeting customer needs. Until today, it represents a massive concern because there is still no system capable of satisfying the speed vs. security nexus for database management. It has led companies to adopt a combination of techniques that indirectly increases running expenses.

### MongoDB vs. CassandraDB: speed and security comparison
MongoDB and CassandraDB are currently some of the most used databases in the tech community. Their usability cuts across finance, health, technical service, and e-commerce industries. We show the evaluation of MongoDB and CassandraDB in line with the speed and security notion below;

#### Speed
While MongoDB and CassandraDB offer significant speed advantages over other databases, CassandraDB can process all forms of data and compress up to 80% of data without delay. The difference serves as a significant advantage over MongoDB, whose over-reliance on a single controller node often causes downtime in its data processing.

#### Security
From research, CassandraDB slightly beats MongoDB regarding security. It is more secure when users want to communicate with the information block/cluster differing from MongoDB, known to be overwhelmed with many integrity issues due to foreign-key constraints that affect data consistency. It is worth noting that MongoDB is more open to ransom attacks from malicious hackers than CassandraDB because it does not automatically enable user authentication.

### Conclusion
The purpose of this article is to provide users with foundational knowledge on the applicability of MongoDB and CassandraDB in the area of speed and security as standalone database systems. From the writer's perspective, CassandraDB is a more preferred Database system to MongoDB as it offers more when it comes to Database speed and security.
