Visual Basic.net is a multi-paradigm, object-oriented programming language. We implement it in the [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net45) developed by Microsoft. They invented Visual Basic in 2001 to replace Visual Basic 6.
<!--more-->
Visual Basic.Net is pronounced as “Visual basic dot net“. We commonly abbreviate it as VB.NET.

Although VB.NET is a developed version of Visual Basic 6, it is not compatible with it, .i.e. we cannot compile code written in Visual Basic 6 under VB.NET.

### Why VB.NET?
- VB.NET is a beginner-friendly language.
- With VB.NET, you can create web applications with modern features like performance counters, file systems, and event logs.
- Since we implement VB.NET using the .NET framework, we can connect our applications to others created in languages that run on the same framework.
- You will enjoy drag-and-drop capabilities to replace any elements that you may need.
- The language is not case sensitive.

Although VB.NET may have a couple of advantages, it also has some drawbacks associated with it. They include :
- VB.NET cannot handle pointers directly.
- Since VB.NET is an intermediate language, many libraries are required for the Just In Time compiler to interpret the application.

To get started, you will need a development environment. This is where we will write and debug our code. We will use [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) as our text editor.

### Installing Visual Basic.Net 
After you have selected Visual Studio, choose .NET desktop to develop and click *Modify*.

![vscode](/engineering-education/getting-started-with-visual-basic-net/visualstudio1.jpg)

After the installation, click *Launch* to get started. On the new window, choose *Create a new project*.

![newproject](/engineering-education/getting-started-with-visual-basic-net/visualstudio2.png)

Once you have selected *Create a new project*, choose *” Install more tools and features"* then click *Next*.

![createproject](/engineering-education/getting-started-with-visual-basic-net/newproject1.png)

Pick *Visual Basic* from the drop-down menu, then select *Console Application* from the list and click *Next*.

![picktemplate](/engineering-education/getting-started-with-visual-basic-net/newproject.png)

Enter your preferred project name and click *Next*. Here, I will name my file *hello world*.

![pickname](/engineering-education/getting-started-with-visual-basic-net/newproject2.png)

After selecting the target framework you desire, click *Create*. Visual Code will auto-generate some VB.NET code for you.

![project](/engineering-education/getting-started-with-visual-basic-net/newproject3.png)

Let’s look at the code.

We have the code generated below. It’s a *Hello World* program.

```vb  
Imports System

Module Program

    Sub Main(args As String())

        Console.WriteLine(“Hello World!”)

    End Sub

End Module 
```

Press the *F5* key on your keyboard to run your program. This will compile and run your code. 

A console window will open with the following output:

```bash
Hello World!

C:\Users\sa\source\repos\helloworld\helloworld\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\helloworld.exe (process 6544) exited with code 0.

To automatically close the Console when debugging stops, enable Tools->Options->Debugging->Automatically close the Console.

Press any key to close this window . . .
```

### The Syntax 
We will look at each line of code from our program generated by Visual Studio. 

**Line 1:** 

```vb
Imports System
```

This line is used to include a *namespace*, system in our program. With that namespace, we will access all the methods defined in it without getting an error.

A Namespace can be defined as a group of codes that are related to each other. It majorly comprises pieces of code such as classes, procedures, and functions.

**Line 2:** 

```vb
Module Program

   ‘code declaration

End Module 
```

A module defines a reference sort obtainable throughout its namespace. For our *HelloWorld* program, we have declared our module and named it `Program.` Inside this module, we will define methods to be used by our program. To close our module, we use the `End` keyword.

**Line 3:** 

```vb
Sub Main(args As String())

     ‘code declaration 

End Sub
```

Our module has one procedure, `Sub`. A procedure is a block of code enclosed by a declaration statement with a matching end declaration. From this line execution of our program will begin. Each program in VB.NET should have a `main` method.

**Line 4:**

```vb

Console.WriteLine(“Hello World!”)

```

`Console.WriteLine()` prints out text on the console. After printing a string, it adds a new line at the end. In our program, it will output  *"Hello World!"*.

Alternatively, we can use `Console.Write()` instead of `Console.WriteLine()` .The major difference is that `Console. Write()` *does not* add a new line at the end of the string. We can find more about the two commands [here](https://www.programiz.com/csharp-programming/basic-input-output).

### Getting user input 
To read the next **characters** from a standard input stream, we use `Console.ReadLine()`.

`Console.Read()` reads the next **Character** from the input.

`Console.ReadKey()` gets the next character pressed by the user. Then, we display the key in the console window.

### Comments in Visual Basic .NET
Comments help a programmer understand what the code does at a particular stage. They are mainly used to make code readable and easy to understand.

The compiler usually ignores comments when compiling the code.

In VB.NET, comments start with a single apostrophe `’`.

**Example**

```vb

    ‘This is a comment in VB.NET.

```

Unfortunately, for Visual Basic, we do not have block comments. All comments are single-line comments.

**Tips on writing good comments**
- Ensure that your comments are not a duplicate of the code you have written. Some programmers write comments that are very obvious and unnecessary.
- When you find it hard to write a simple comment, your code might be where the problem is.
- Your comments should clear any confusion, not create it.
- Incorporate links to additional references where you feel they will be most helpful.
- Write comments when fixing bugs, too.

> **Note:** VB.NET follows top-to-bottom order when executing a program.

**Congratulations!** You just wrote your first VB.NET program.  

To learn a few more terms, we will write a simple program to add two numbers entered by the user.

```vb
Imports System

Module Program

    Sub Main(args As String())

        Dim firstNum, seconNum, sum As Integer

        Console.WriteLine(“enter first number:”)

        firstNum = Console.ReadLine()

        Console.WriteLine(“ enter second number:”)

        seconNum = Console.ReadLine()

        sum = firstNum + seconNum

        Console.WriteLine(“the sum is:” & sum)

        Console.ReadLine()

    End Sub

End Module
```

Here’s how the output will look like when we input our first number as 2 and the second as 6 :

```bash
enter the first number:

2

 enter the second number:

6

the sum is:8
```

Let’s look at the new lines in this program.

```vb
Dim firstNum, seconNum, sum As Integer
```

This line declares variables that will store the user input and the result of the addition by the system.

`As Integer` means that the declared variables will be of the data type Integer `Int`. Apart from integers, we have other data types, such as 
- String - stores any numerical, alphabetic, and special characters
- Double - stores fractional numbers
- Boolean - stores data as either True or False
- Date - stores the date value and has a range of January 1, 0001 - December 31, 9999. 
    
```vb
firstNum = Console.ReadLine()
```

This line assigns the user input to our declared variable for storage. We can see that we repeat this step for the second input under a different variable. This is because a variable can only hold value for one input. So in case, we assign a second, it will replace the original one.

### Conclusion
In this tutorial, we looked at :

- Setting up a Visual Basic.NET development environment.
- A sample of Visual Basic.NET that prints “Hello World”.
- Writing a program to add two numbers from the user input.
- Tips on writing good comments

Happy coding!
