### Project Tech Stack

Due to limited time to develop and deploy the project, I decide to go with Python and Django framework because of the simplicity and ease of use. In as much as I have have worked with Python and Dajngo before, this came as a challenge since my core experience is on Mobile application development.

After going through the available APIS, I decided to go with the [News API](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines). Although Parsing the JSON response was a bit of challenge, I was able to parse the data and pass it to the Django template.

### KEI Deployment Process
I used the Section KEI platform to deploy the project. The deployment process was a bit complicated due to the abstraction of some Kubernetes components such as Ingress and Loadbalancer. The documentation was of great help though the documentation was not having indepth explanation on some of the concepts.

Although it was my first time configuring a domain, I was able to get the domain to work. This was a great learning experience after messing up with the domain DNS records üòä. I later learned that using sections hosted nameservers was the easiest way to get the domain working instead of going the CNAME and A records way.
