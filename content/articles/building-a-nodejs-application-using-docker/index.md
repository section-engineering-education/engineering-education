[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) allows us to run our applications as *containers*. A container is a standalone executable package that is lightweight and has everything needed to run an application be it libraries, tools, runtime, settings, or code.

In this tutorial, we will build a Node.js application, create an image, and also build a container using the image. Enjoy!

### Dockerize the Node.js Application
To start this tutorial, we need to make sure Docker and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) are installed on our system. If Docker is not, you can refer to the links below to download:
- [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntu/)
- [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
- [MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

To dockerize a Node.js application, we need to follow these steps:

- Create a Node.js application
- Create a Dockerfile
- Building your Docker Image
- Expose

### Step 1 - Creating a Node.js Application
First, we will start by creating a directory for our project and then install some dependencies for our simple Hello World website.

```bash
 mkdir node-web-app
 cd node-web-app
```

### Install npm And Express Framework
Install npm and Express, which is a Node.js framework. Then, initialize npm in our directory.

```bash
 npm init
```

npm creates a `package.json` that holds the dependencies of the app. Next, install the Express framework dependency.

```bash
 npm install express --save
```

Result:

```js
{
  "name": "web-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {},
  "description": ""
}

```

Create an `app.js` file with an HTTP server that will set up the Hello World site:

```js
//Load express module with `require` directive
var express = require('express')
var app = express()

//Define request response in root URL (/)
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

//Launch listening server on port 8080
app.listen(8080, function () {
  console.log('app listening on port 8080!')
})
```

### Run The Application
The app is ready to launch:

```bash
$ node app.js
```

Go to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser to view it.

#### Step 2 - Create A DockerFile
Create a file in the root directory called `Dockerfile`.

The first thing is we need to define which image we want to build from. Here we will use version `9` of `node` available from Docker Hub:

```bash
FROM node:9
```

Next, create the working directory for your application.

```bash
# Create app directory
WORKDIR /app
```

Install the app dependencies using the `npm` binary.

```bash
# Install app dependencies
COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install
```

Copy the rest of the application to the app directory.

```bash
COPY /app
```

Expose the port and start the application.

```bash
Expose 8080

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Your `Dockerfile` should look like this:

```bash
FROM node:9

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install app dependencies
COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

# Copying rest of the application to app directory
COPY . /app

# Expose the port and start the application
Expose 8080

CMD ["npm","start"]
```

*NOTE: Above you will notice we used two distinct COPY commands to reduce the application rebuild time*

#### .dockerignore file
Create a `.dockerignore` file so as not to copy unnecessary files to the container:

```bash
node_modules
npm-debug.log
```

This prevents the local module and debug logs from being copied onto your Docker image.

#### Step 3 - Building your Docker Image
Building your Docker image is quite easy and can be done using a single command.

```bash
docker build -t <docker-image-name> <filepath>
```

*The `-t` flag lets you tag your image so it's easier to find later*

For example:

```bash
docker build -t cisca .
```

Result:

```bash
Sending build context to Docker daemon  19.97kB

 ---> faa3092e5595
Successfully built faa3092e5595
Successfully tagged cisca:latest
```

You should get something similar to the output above after executing the command. This means that the docker image was created successfully and the app is working fine.

Now that the build is complete, you can check your image:

```bash
docker image ls
```

Result:

```bash
REPOSITORY                    TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
cisca                         latest              faa3092e5595        4 minutes ago       675MB
node                          12-alpine           08a8c8089ab1        2 weeks ago         673MB
```

#### Step 4 - Run a Container
Now we can run the docker image using the command:

```bash
docker run -d -p <Host port>:<Docker port> <docker-image-name>
```

-d flag indicates the docker container is running in the background. The -p flag specifies which host port will be connected to the docker port.

Example:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 cisca
```

Result:

```bash
34fe3040ff6b9d1b593a3c5d650ef0f16d53a989fe41816634456dd7f1341183
```

### Conclusion
Use the `docker ps` command to check the running container.

```bash
docker ps -a
```

Result:

```bash
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE         COMMAND           CREATED              STATUS                          PORTS                    NAMES
