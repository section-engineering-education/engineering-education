Choosing the right JavaScript framework for a project can be challenging and confusing. Today, there are many resources capable of supporting different project requirements. Some of the popular front-end frameworks are Angular and React.js. Selecting the right framework requires knowledge of several critical aspects.
<!--more-->
### Goal
This article discusses and compares the two most used front-end platforms; [Angular](https://angular.io/docs) and [React.js](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

### Angular and React.js
Angular is a fully-fledged JavaScript framework, while React.js is a JavaScript library. The table below helps us understand the technical specifications of React.js and Angular.

Factor|Angular|React.js |
----------------|-------|----- |
Release Year| 2016 | 2013
Ideal For| Creating highly interactive web applications | Creating large web applications with varying data
DOM | Real | Virtual
App Size | Relatively small | Relatively small
Performance | High | High
Dynamic UI Binding | UI binding at a plain object or property level | Direct linking of states to the UI
Data Binding | Two-way | One-way
Learning Curve | Steep | Moderate
UI Rendering | Client/Server-side | Client/Server-side
Price | Open-source | Open-source

#### Popularity growth
Angular and React have gained much popularity in the recent past. Both have been featured in numerous discussions and forums. However, React.js has more users due to its earlier release, as well as a moderate learning curve.

#### Performance
Both React.js and Angular offer high performance. However, React.js is faster due to its one-way data binding. Angular, on the other hand, has numerous tools that help cut development time. For instance, Angular has a [cacheFactory](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$cacheFactory) feature that helps store and retrieve data.

React.js, on the other hand, supports component reusability which is quite productive.

#### Testing
Since JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, it is quite challenging to identify bugs. Therefore, code written in JavaScript has to go through a robust set of tests. Angular solves this problem by providing several features which support the isolation of the unit code. 

For instance, Angular has a [dependency injection](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-quick-intro-to-dependency-injection-what-it-is-and-when-to-use-it-7578c84fa88f/) tool which assists in passing data between different components. In React.js, it is easy to conduct tests due to the availability of [Mocking Functions](https://jestjs.io/docs/mock-function-api).

React.js also comes with test runners such as [Ava](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ava), [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

`Jest` is compatible with other features such as [Mocked Node modules](https://jestjs.io/docs/manual-mocks), [Timers](https://jestjs.io/docs/timer-mocks), and [Jdsm](https://openbase.com/js/jest-date-mock). Furthermore, libraries such as Mocha can support simulations just like a real browser.

#### Code quality
[Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) helps to improve code quality. It supports integrations from [Angular Core](https://angular.io/api/core) and [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/guide/getting-started).

React.js also has numerous plugins that increase the code quality. For instance, [Linters](https://www.testim.io/blog/what-is-a-linter-heres-a-definition-and-quick-start-guide/) uses a set of strict rules to ensure that there is consistency.

#### Code maintainability
Angular is used when developing single-page applications. Such applications have complex structures, as well as several programming modules. To maintain such a complex structure, developers must choose a flexible and reliable framework.

The code maintainability is a huge problem when building rich web clients. In addition, using both JavaScript and HTML is challenging due to the minimal modularization. Angular overcomes these challenges through the use of maintainable JavaScript and HTML extensions.

React.js is better than Angular when writing clean code, especially when there are short deadlines. As stated, React.js allows developers to reuse numerous components and thus, save time.

#### Server rendering
Angular supports pre-rendering of views. However, developers can use both JSON and [client-side caching](https://medium.com/js-360/intro-to-client-side-caching-with-service-worker-354ce8ae831a) to boost the server's performance. Angular is much better when it comes to reducing traffic between client and server.

Angular also minimizes the need for recompiling. Since it updates UI components quickly in case of data changes.

For an application to have excellent [SEO](https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo), it needs to be rendered on the server. React.js has specialized functions that support this feature. A perfect example is the [RenderToString()](https://www.npmjs.com/package/preact-render-to-string) method. 

In addition, the [renderToStaticMarkup()](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html) function can prevent the creation of Document Object Model ([DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)) attributes such as data-react-id. These elements are responsible for creating a static page generator.

#### Optimizing the bundle size
Though working with single-page applications may seem easy, managing the bundle file size is quite challenging. Many websites have a low loading speed. This is because the bundle file has to be downloaded. This means that the site should be optimized as much as possible.

The `bundle size` is essential when developing an enterprise application. Keeping the size small allows the website to run more smoothly. However, it may be difficult to maintain the size due to the addition of new features and dependencies.

#### Learning curve
Since Angular is quite broad, it has a steeper learning curve. New developers may find it difficult to cover some topics in Angular. 

React.js, on the other hand, has a flatter learning curve. It is easier for developers to understand it since it uses JavaScript Syntax. Some of the few challenging areas include state management and routing.

### Reasons for using Angular
-   It has inbuilt features such as AngularCLI and [Rxjs](https://www.learnrxjs.io/) which help in handling different events. 
-   It increases productivity by having fewer lines of code and components.
-   It supports high-performance applications.
-   It enhances rapid server-side rendering which improves user experience.

### Reasons for using React.js
-   It has dependencies such as [Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started), which assist in the faster development of scalable applications.
-   It converts [JavaScript XML](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) into JavaScript for the browser to understand.
-   It uses code bundlers such as [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/) to organize JavaScript files.
-   Routing is much easier in React.js through the use of [ReactRouter](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start).

### Angular and React.js use cases
Both Angular and React.js have been used to develop popular applications in the world. 

Below are two use cases for Angular and React.js:

#### Case 1:
For an application with a complex UI, React.js is simpler to use. React.js also has a shorter learning curve than Angular.

#### Case 2:
Angular is regarded as a complete package since it has numerous built-in functionalities. One cannot compare Angular functionalities with those of a JavaScript library such as React.js.

### Conclusion
Depending on the project requirements, one can choose between Angular and React.js. For example, a developer can use React.js for short projects that require a smaller learning curve. 

React.js is easy to use since the developer does not have to organize HTML code and can reuse UI components. On the other hand, when developing a vast application with extensive features, the team can go for Angular due to its extensive features.

Happy learning!
