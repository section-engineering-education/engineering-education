### Building Web Applications With DevExtreme

Building Web applications from scratch as a Web developer can be painful and time-consuming.

As web developers, we want to build fast and responsive web applications. Since we are always implementing the same UI component in every project, Components like authentication, headers, user menu, footer, Navigation e.t.c. so why start over and over again. DevExtreme is here to take all the pain away. Devextreme is one of the [DevExpress](https://www.devexpress.com/) components. It includes the collection of high-performance and responsive UI widgets which can be used to build both mobile and web applications.

DevExtreme mainly works with Javascript frameworks which are Angular, React jQuery & Vue. It can also be used with technologies like ASP.NET MVC, Knockout & ASP.NET Core. It is fast and easy to use cause of its ready-built responsive UI components e.g. Interactive charts components, Data editors, Drop Down Box, and much more. DevExtreme can also be added to existing applications. [Read More](https://js.devexpress.com/).

```bash
npx -p devextreme-cli devextreme new angular-app my-extreme-app

```
- After the installation, I have to cd into the project
```bash
cd my-extreme-app

```
- to start my application
```bash
npm run start

```
To view your DevExtreme template. DevExtreme runs on default port `http://localhost:4200/` so check the URL on your favorite browser. Always remember to go through the ReadMe file before starting the application in case of any change or update. 

**Note** DevExtreme application template comes with Drawer, Data Grid, and forms Components.

### Default Template View

### DevExtreme ThemeBuilder
Manipulating DevExtreme is really easy. The ThemeBuilder is a tool that allows you to customize themes based on the DevExtreme default theme. [DevEtreme ThemeBuilder](https://devexpress.github.io/ThemeBuilder/).
 To configure the template theme open `src\themes\metadata.additional.json` and `src\themes\metadata.base.json` in the template,  edit the theme color in the json file, then run `npm run build-themes` . By default, the theme is orange as you can see in the image above. So I changed mine to blue in the two json files.
```bash
{
  "items": [],
  "baseTheme": "material.blue.light",
  "assetsBasePath": "../../../node_modules/devextreme/dist/css/",
  "outputColorScheme": "base",
  "base": true
}
```

```bash
{
 {
  "items": [],
  "baseTheme": "material.blue.dark",
  "assetsBasePath": "../../../node_modules/devextreme/dist/css/",
  "outputColorScheme": "additional",
  "makeSwatch": true,
  "base": true,
  "widgets": [
    "treeview",
    "navbar"
  ]
}
}
```

As you can see above I changed mine to blue. [Click](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Predefined_Themes/) to view DevExtreme predefined themes using Material Designs themes and Generic Compact.
