---
In a world that keeps evolving and technology keeps changing, art captioning our feeling have led a new generation that loves art. A million pieces of artwork get created annually, and 1,000,000 of that artwork get stolen. 

According to the [darknet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet), the stolen artwork market is valued at over 6 billion dollars annually. This number is due to the digital era where big tech has led to sending of digital artwork, memes, tweets, music, and video in the form of GIFs and MP4. 

Combating the losses has led to the introduction of non-fungible tokens. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have become a popular online investment in conjunction with Crypto-currency since they are secure and authentic. Most people ask themselves, what are NFTS, how are they NFTs created, what are the threats to them, are they securities, or are they fraud? In this article, we will discuss and explain all these concepts in detail.

### Prerequisites
- Basics of [Blockchain technology](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp).
- Basics of [Web 3.0 technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3).
- Basics of [NFT technology](https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq).

### What is an NFT?
[Non-fungible token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) (NFT) is a digital asset that represents real-world objects like art, music, and in-game items, and videos. We store NFTs in a publicly accessible [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) blockchain. NFTs cannot be traded or exchanged at equivalency when compared to [cryptocurrencies](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-cryptocurrency), and the tokens are unique. 

Different contents such as digital arts, movies, and music records, have been converted into NFTs. The creation of digital NFT has exploded into the mainstream leading to the creation of [Decentralized finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance) and [Decentralised autonomous organizations](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/defi-decentralized-finance/)

NFT allow the buyer to own the original item digitally. It contains built-in authentication, which serves as proof of ownership. NFTs owners value those digital bragging rights almost more than the item itself.

### The characteristics of the non-fungible tokens
The following are some of the characteristics of the non-fungible tokens:

- Linkage to a physical or virtual asset. It expresses the immutable right of possession.

- Verification of the history of ownership. An NFT has an inbuilt verification system that tracks the history of ownership of the digital asset.

### Where to buy NFT
Do you ever ask yourself, where do I buy the NFT? I used to ask myself the same. The most popular sites to buy an NFT are follows:

- [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/)
It has over 13.3 billion USD market value, the first and largest peer-to-peer marketplace for non-fungible tokens.

- [Nifty Gateway](https://niftygateway.com/)
It is digital art online auction platform for non-fungible tokens.

- [Rarible](https://rarible.com/)
also known as RARI, it a software that allows creators to create and issue ownership of selling custom digital work. It links sellers with buyers who can select pieces they wish to purchase.

- [Foundation](https://nfoundation.pw/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=g&utm_content=591472369592&utm_term=foundation%20nft)
what a piece of art, a  creative playground for artists, curators, and collectors to experience the new creative economy.

### Examples of NFTs
The following are examples of NFTs:

- [Nyan Cat GIF](https://tenor.com/search/nyan-cat-gifs)
On April 2, 2011, a 25-year-old Christopher Torres of Dallas, Texas, posted the GIF animation of the cat and sold it for more than $1m. He uses the name "prguitarman" on his website LOL-Comics. 

- [Jack Dorsey's first-ever tweet](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-07/dorsey-s-first-tweet-offered-for-48-million-on-nft-marketplace)
Jack Dorsey sold his first-ever tweet for $2.9m (£2.1m) to a Malaysia-based businessman.

- [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/)
CryptoKitties is a blockchain game on Ethereum developed by Canadian studio Dapper Labs that allows players to purchase, collect, breed, and sell virtual cats.

- [Cryptovoxels](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/)
Cryptovoxels is a virtual gaming world (Metaverse) powered by the Ethereum blockchain. Players can buy land and build stores and art galleries in this virtual world.

### Understanding NFTs possible threats
The following are NFTs possible threats:

- Cyber Security and identity fraud
Last fall, Facebook announced its rebranding and creating a [Metaverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse). The growth of the digital world, blockchain, and the metaverse have led to the emergence of the digital asset known as NFT. 

NFT has resulted in cybersecurity and also fraud cases. With the advancement of new technologies, black-hat hackers have found a way to gain an advantage of the system. Many hackers tend to create fake stores with the capability to mirror the logo and contents of the original NFT store. These counterfeits may be passed off as the real thing and sold. This may lead to a user buying a fake NFT, which leads to copyright issues since there can only be one NFT.

- Identity fraud
Cases of artists having their work sold by others as an NFT without permission have significantly risen. Many scam artists have set up unauthorized customer support channels and social media accounts that pretend to be the real NFT exchange artists and sell fake NFTS with their names. They also end up stealing customer information and compromising their accounts.

- Vulnerabilities in the smart contract security
In 2021, [Cross-Chain Defi Site Poly Network](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/10/cross-chain-defi-site-poly-network-hacked-hundreds-of-millions-potentially-lost/) was the headline. The platform Poly Network was attacked, with the alleged hacker draining roughly $610 million in crypto.

According to the report released, anonymous white-hat hackers or hackers successfully stole the fund by exploiting vulnerabilities in the smart-contract code. Poly Network is an interoperability protocol for heterogeneous blockchains, which lets users swap tokens from one digital ledger to another.  It is exchanged between several blockchains as users trade one cryptocurrency for another. Despite the recovery of the assets in 15 days, this incident proves that smart contracts cannot discard the risk of cyberattacks.

- Editable metadata
Metadata is structured reference data that sort and identify attributes of the information it describes. Metadata is a prefix that mostly means an underlying definition or description. 

NFTs are digital assets that contain metadata that defines them. Editing the metadata of an NFT may destroy the rarity aspect of the NFT and can affect its value. A collector will now have a reason not to buy the NFT collection. It is like painting on top of the famous [Mona Lisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa) portrait painting.

- Valuation Challenge
Owners of an NFT may over-hype an asset to inflate the value, only to cash out. The other collectors will suffer from the subsequent decline in value.

- NFT as a security
After the [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-02/sec-scrutinizes-nft-market-over-illegal-crypto-token-offerings) (SEC) demanded information on ceratin NFT, it created a red flag for the NFT according to [Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/), which led to a fine of $100m issued to the crypto trading platform [BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/) for falsely labeling high-yield lending products as securities.

### Possible NFTs security solutions (how to secure NFTs)
The following are the possible NFTs security solutions:

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
It's an electronic authentication method where a user is granted access to an application or website only after successfully presenting two or more evidence (code or factors) to an authentication mechanism. 

A hacker can easily hack an NFT user account due to a lack of multi-factor authentication. MFA tends to lower cybercriminal attacks since it protects user data from being accessed by any other unauthorized third party.

- Use a unique password for your account
Big tech companies do emphasize on use of a unique and strong password. NFT websites require you to create strong and unique passwords that are easy to memorize. For example,  'Jt5e-79P-B13^qS'. To create a unique and strong password, use special characters, upper case, lower cases, and combination digits.

In NFT or any website, do not use two or more similar passwords in which most of their characters are the same. For example,
'Drakeyoungmoney34' or 'Drake youngmoney43', makes it easier for hackers to guess and remember if one of these passwords is compromised, then it means that all of these passwords are at risk.

Don't store your password on a password retrieving website, but write down your password on a clean piece of paper. It will help you secure your NFTs and crypto-wallets.

- Avoid cold emails and downloading files from strangers 
We all have received an email promoting a company or a document. The emails usually seem too good to be true since they are unsolicited. It is best not to interact with email or QR codes sent by a stranger since they are known to contain harmful malware or viruses. It may lead to a stranger stealing your password or mirroring your screen and later compromising your account by stealing your Nft or your identity.

-  Smart contracts transaparency
A smart contract is a computer program or a transaction protocol that will automatically execute, control, or document legally relevant events and actions according to the contract terms or a legal agreement. Smart contracts play a role in NFT transactions and form the building blocks of any NFT platform. They remove the outcome and third parties. 

Many enterprises use smart contracts in their daily operations. These enterprises prefer smart contracts because they enforce and build trust in blockchain technology. 

Smart contacts have massive implications for both media and digital platforms. When dealing with smart contracts, you must ensure to customize the smart contract limit when approving a transaction to reduce any negative implications.

-  Regularly update your software.
The future of Nft is getting brighter with time, and raising security concerns is also increasing. You must ensure the NFT software runs smoothly by regularly updating to the latest version of the software available for your device. It will fix the bugs in the driver software after the new update. It leads to reduced cyber threats.

- Secure internet connection
Securing your internet connection at home is essential to protecting yourself from online threats and enjoying peace of mind when you go online. It lowers the risk of hackers getting in touch with your NFT accounts and your hardware wallets.

#### Software and hot storage crypto wallets
There are different types of wallets described as both software and hardware. The following are some of the top NFT wallets available right now:

- [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/)

Metaverse galleries are coming in hot, and even [Mark Cuban’s](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/84424/mark-cubans-nft-company-caught-promoting-scams-for-25-000-post/index.html) wants to bring NFT ticketing to the NBA that will entitle buyers to lifetime front row seats at their tours, the NFT space is fast-changing.

With over $4.8 billion sold on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), the NFT  market will boom and grow to greater heights. The future of NFT is full of possibilities, and the market will grow exponentially.

### Wrapping up
The NFT market is still new, but it will keep growing due to the increasing demand. The investors will gain a lot of profits in the coming years and reap the best rewards. For the newbies who want to join the NFT market, please make sure you pick the right wallet so you will be able to secure your NFTS because the market also has potential threats.
