Consistency is key. That’s what Divine believes in and he says he benefits from that fact which is why he tries to be consistent in whatever he does in gaining permission-less leverage through accountability. Divine is currently a software engineer and technical writer who spends his days’ building software and writing about it.

Aside from the world of software he enjoys watching football (soccer), listening to good music, traveling and having fun in his own way.
