Mike White is a second-year Computer Science student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. His interests are technology, philosophy, culture, music, and effective altruism. Mike has a blog about technology and philosophy. If he isn’t doing any of that, then he’s probably either playing a Sherlock Holmes video game or watching YouTube.
